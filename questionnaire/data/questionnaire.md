A questionnaire for testing people's awareness of (the directionality of) changes, with questions tapping into their explicit knowledge of:

1. their own frequency of use
2. their interlocutors' frequency of use
3. the `age' of a variant (a naive way to get at their impression of the real-time nature of a change)
4. the apparent time development of a change (asking about younger/older speakers' frequency of use)

Now with 4 pages per individual: questions about a changing variable (imperatives, p.1), a stable one (negation, p.2), and two more changing and almost completed ones (yes/no questions and wh questions, p.3+4).

The order of presentation of the two variants, their order in the 'which is older' question, and the order of the younger/older speakers question are all randomised, so there's 8 different versions of the same 4-page questionnaire.

Open questions/things to try out/change away from too much linguistics lingo:

1. replace '*use* this variant' with '*say*'?
2. do people understand 'negating a sentence'?
3. change from "people around you" to "people in Shetland" or "people you normally talk to"
4. change from "Which variant do you think is *older*" to "Which variant do you think has been around for longer?"
