Intro

* thanks for coming
* in the spirit of the original idea behind the syntactic change group: present work in progress
* we've collected data already, we're very much looking for feedback on what to make of the data and how it relates to other work

* now that we know the context of these ongoing syntactic changes (from the point of linguistic description)
* the second part of the presentation: how accessible is the 'ongoingness' of these changes to the speakers in this community
* to motivate why we should be interested in whether speakers are aware of it or not I'm going to summarise 60 years of sociolinguistic research in one slide

Motivation
* main results of sociolinguistic research: changes propagate systematically not just across space, but across demographic groups, based on factors like SES, gender
* two questions: how does a demographic group 'know' when to adopt a variant, and how does it know to 'advance' the change further?
* while the factors influencing #1 are complex and manifold, at least for the second problem of 'incrementation' across age groups, Bill Labov's recent idea: age vectors

* socio work: how does variant usage influence your perception of a speaker?
* here the inverse: what do you infer/know/believe about variants based on who uses them?

Awareness of changes

* qualitative evaluations (mainly negative) cross-culturally omnipresent
* anecdotal evidence strewn across the literature: Guy on declaratives, similar commentare on uptalk and like-quotatives..
* haven't found quantitative studies on how consistent and reliable people's knowledge is (although if you know any please point them out!)

* quantifying awareness: Walker and Hay on *implicit* knowledge
* but: lexical items - not really about changes in progress, influenced by semantic domain

Current project
* tackle question: how (& how much) are speakers aware of apparent time differences?
* four variables
* questionnaire methodology
* 5 questions per sociolinguistic variable - explicit questions about people's perceived variable usage rates (you'll see what that means in a minute)
* fast
* questionnaire responses can be unreliable: people will overreport using 'prestigious' variants (at least for their own speech)
* while there are certainly fancier implicit knowledge methods: a good way to investigate a very low-frequency variable

* a bit old-fashioned within sociolinguistics (superceded by recording methods)


Q1
* the same lexical item for every subject
* outgoing on the left, incoming on the right
* first two questions: tap into own + community usage estimates

Q3: linguistic historian

Q4+5: sociolinguist

Five questions x four variables

* for negation: (local) minority variant on the left, main variant on the right
* questionnaires supplied in that order, i.e. imperatives, neg, ynq, whq

Results method & hypotheses

* ordinal data
* classification & regression trees to determine potential effects
* ordinal regression (ordered logit regression) to test specific effects

1. to what degree do individuals perceive (& report) apparent time differences
2. other effects: women as leaders of change often argued to be based on them being more 'status conscious' or aware of the social significance of linguistic variants -> stronger perception of apparent time differences?

Results: estimated own usage - model

* changing variables: consistent with acceptability judgments - imperatives lagging behind
* negation: 4 Whalsay speakers reporting the local minority variant

Results: difference between own+community usage

* because age influences the self report, but not the community report, this is also predicted well by age
* more people seem to report themselves to be ahead of the curve BUT this could be due to categorical ceiling effect

Results: variant `age'

* basic questions show us that informants give reasonable answers
* we enter the diachronic realm / awareness of changes
* answers to the question: which variant is *older*?
* look at all 4 variables: basic pattern - changing vs. stable

Results: apparent time differences

* for changing variables: majority report young speakers 'ahead' of older ones
* BUT similar (if slightly less extreme) pattern for negation??

Disentangling beliefs about variants from apparent time estimates

* point was to figure out 1) socio-historical connotation vs. 2) apparent time
* didn't expect age connotation to play such a role, so Q3 always preceds Q4+5
* confusingly, apparent time differences reported for neg (where we really wouldn't/shouldn't expect any)
* 'local' > dialectal > old-fashioned > older speakers?
* account for it by only looking at speakers who report no age connotations
* at least part of the effect seems to be driven by whether variable is changing or not -> indicative of some degree of actual apparent time perception(beyond beliefs)

Conclusions

* we've presented a new, simple questionnaire methodology to assess people's awareness of ongoing changes
* shown that (at least for this change):
* people's self-reported usage levels consistent with acceptability judgments
* sadly no production data to test against - would be interesting thing to do (i.e. include this kind of methodology as exit questionnaire)
* people know whether they're ahead/behind
* people have correct beliefs about: 'age' connotations and/or apparent time differences?

* we were aiming for 'objective' knowledge about variable usage
* underestimated the impact of social connotation
