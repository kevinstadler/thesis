\section{Connecting innovation and selection}

In its opening chapters, this thesis provided a very general overview of the myriad `pressures' and `biases' that have been proposed to influence language change. Chapter~\ref{ch:momentummodel} investigated a new selection pressure based on the idea of trend-amplification, with Chapter~\ref{ch:questionnaire} contributing to the existing empirical evidence that such a momentum-based approach is a psychologically viable candidate mechanism for language change.
Having honed in on one particular mechanism, this final chapter is intended to `zoom out' again to connect the idea of momentum-based selection, a \emph{symmetric} mechanism which does not predict any of the competing linguistic variants to be more prevalent than any other, with other pressures which might contribute the asymmetry and unidirectional paths that we find in real language changes. By combining a model of asymmetric innovation of variants with a symmetric selection mechanism we arrive at a more complete, if more complex, picture of the underlying dynamics of language change.
%The goal is to draw the many pressures that were touched upon back together in a systematic way,

Section~\ref{sec:arbitrariness} starts off with a recapitulation of the evolutionary framework of language change and provides theoretical motivations for why momentum could (and should) be relevant for language change research.

In order to get a more systematic grip on different \emph{types} of pressures, Section~\ref{sec:asymmetricvariation} will introduce the \emph{Wright-Fisher model} of biological evolution and investigate it using the Markov model toolkit that was already used in Section~\ref{sec:markovmodel}. The main purpose of this is to allow us to study a toy model of the dynamics and interaction of the two basic evolutionary pressures, namely the \emph{innovation} of variants as opposed to their \emph{selection}. Having covered the basics of the Wright-Fisher model as well as its predictions regarding the interaction of the different pressures, Section~\ref{sec:asymmetricmomentum} will provide an extension that implements a momentum-based selection bias. The point of the model is to show how the interaction of asymmetric innovation and a neutral selection bias like momentum can provide an explanation not just of the dynamics of language change, but also of the skewed synchronic distribution of linguistic variants that we observe cross-linguistically.
%Finally, Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} offers an overall summary and conclusion of the thesis, as well as a look forward to future work.

%\section{A history \& motivation of momentum}

%If there's already so much work on different pressures, why should we need momentum-based selection? Apart from the empirical reasons (which still need plenty of filling in), there are also theoretical reasons why we should \emph{a priori} prefer a mechanism like momentum-based selection over functional ones.

\section{Language change, arbitrariness, replicator-neutrality}\index{arbitrariness}
\label{sec:arbitrariness}

%This is exactly the stance taken by Croft and Labov
A core feature of momentum as it was presented in Chapter~\ref{ch:momentummodel} was that it created directed selection pressures while being \emph{replicator-neutral}, i.e.~without favouring either of the competing variants a priori. Why is this particularly relevant to language change?
When going back to the roots of modern-day linguistics, we can uncover a strong theoretical reason for why language changes should be replicator-neutral. One of the central tenets of Ferdinand de Saussure's \emph{Course in general linguistics}~(\citeyear{Saussure1959}) is the principle of the \emph{arbitrariness of the sign}. The principle states that linguistic signs, i.e.~the association of a specific signifier~(typically a sequence of speech sounds) to a specific signified~(an object or concept referred to by using the signifier) is not `motivated' by any~(physical) semblance between the two. The linguistic sign is \emph{arbitrary} in the sense that the association between form and meaning is primarily established on \emph{social} grounds.
%In lay terms, a given signal is arbitrary if it could as well have been expressed using another
According to this definition linguistics is chiefly the study of \emph{conventional} as opposed to `natural' associations and, while Saussure was explicitly referring to lexical conventions, modern approaches to grammar which challenge the categorical distinction between lexicon and morphosyntax~\citep[e.g.~Construction Grammar, ][]{Goldberg1995} suggest that his principle can be extrapolated to morphosyntactic constructions~(such as syntactic constituent order) as well.

Even though the principle of arbitrariness has been challenged superficially on many grounds \citep[in particular by work on sound-symbolism, see e.g.][]{Nygaard2009}, it has maintained its place as a cornerstone of linguistics to this day~\citep{Joseph2000}.
But how is the principle of arbitrariness relevant to language change? While Saussure's distinction of the `synchronic' versus the `diachronic' study of language was also the origin of the schism between research on the two topics that characterised much of 20th century linguistics discussed in Chapter~\ref{ch:review}, the arbitrariness of the sign also speaks to diachronic processes.

As made explicit by evolutionary frameworks, the linguistic conventions we find today are there because they have come about and spread through historical processes, in particular their replication and selection. So, if we want to maintain that the conventions we find synchronically are in fact \emph{arbitrary}, we have to believe that their diachronic development, and in particular any \emph{selection} of specific conventions over their competitors, occurred on arbitrary grounds as well~\citep[but see][p.93]{Joseph2015}.

Here we find, once again, the diverging priorities of researchers working on language change on the \emph{macro} and \emph{micro} level, as well as the potential disconnect between the two approaches. While skewed macro-level patterns and distributions across languages will be taken to suggest some degree of non-arbitrariness or motivatedness in the selection of specific linguistic traits, researchers working on an individual change~(which might or might not conform to the larger scale patterns) will have very different, particular criteria to determine the presence~(or cause) of selection in their micro-level data. This disconnect between the two explanatory levels of language change is acknowledged very explicitly by Ohala when he states that

\begin{quote}
As for the immediate triggers of sound change in a particular language at a particular time, I will have little to say about them except to suggest that these things are bound to happen and that it is not so interesting to try to identify them.~\citep[p.174]{Ohala1989} % more cool stuff on nomological explanations not existing anywhere and everything being probabilistic on p.175
\end{quote}

This dismissal of the (study of) factors responsible for triggering individual changes could be taken to indicate a certain degree of frustration about the struggle to unify the reliable and frequently attested large-scale patterns across languages with the idiosyncracy of individual changes.

Unlike Ohala, I suggest that the shortcomings in the prediction of individual changes can also be framed in constructive terms, as a test for competing accounts of language change. What the theoretical arguments presented above as well as the empirical evidence suggest is that a good theory of language change should predict \emph{that} changes happen, \emph{which} changes are more likely to happen than others, but all the while accounting for the sporadic nature of changes, i.e.~not making overspecific claims about being able to accurately predict which changes are going to happen where.
What this theory should be able to predict is not just language changes themselves, but also \emph{the degree of their unpredictability}, i.e.~it should have a theory of and explanation for its own limitations.
%a model that predicts \emph{spontaneous actuations} (`noise-activated transitions' in the terms of \citealt{Mitchener2016})

This is exactly the promise made by the evolutionary, replicator-based stance taken by Labov and Croft which decouples the two processes of \emph{innovation} of linguistic variants as opposed to their \emph{selection}. While the function-driven repeated innovation of similar variants across languages can account for the distribution or likelihood of different types of changes overall, as measured by their cross-linguistic `actuation probability'\index{actuation!actuation probability}, the actuation of specific changes is explained by arbitrary (social) pressures that \emph{explicitly underspecify} predictions about whether a specific change is about to happen in a language or not.

While the advantages of this `division of labour' have long been argued for theoretically, the approach has not seen wide adoption in the empirical and modelling literature, as I discussed in Section~\ref{sec:evolutionaryapproaches}. Arguably, this is largely due to the absence of concrete candidate mechanisms for the second, arbitrary selection step. As was argued in Section~\ref{sec:prestige}, the default account of socially driven change invokes the concept of sociolinguistic \emph{prestige}, which is based on asymmetric selection biases that can only be posited \emph{post-hoc} on an individual basis.
The subsequent lack of testable predictions made by social accounts that would generalise across changes means that, on the macro-level, asymmetric social pressures have largely been disregarded at the expense of equally replicator selection-based functional accounts of language change, which do however make a priori predictions.

The momentum-based selection account presented in this thesis constitutes a more mechanistic explanation of socially-driven changes beyond `prestige' accounts.
With this new mechanism in mind, the remainder of this chapter is dedicated to demonstrating based on a toy model how the interaction between innovation and selection biases more generally, as well as between asymmetric innovation and momentum-based selection in particular, can satisfy the requirements of a theory of language change outlined above.

\chapter{Summary, conclusion \& outlook}\label{ch:conclusion}

In this thesis I have adopted an evolutionary approach to language change and argued for its importance in explaining and reconciling some seemingly contradictory results and scientific standpoints regarding the nature of and mechanisms behind language change.
Following a broad overview of different explanations and accounts of language change as well as formal models of change in particular, I introduced and analysed the dynamics of a new model of the momentum-based selection of linguistic variants in Chapter~4. The fieldwork on individuals' explicit awareness of ongoing syntactic changes in Shetland presented in Chapter~5 contributed to existing evidence regarding the acquisition of sociolinguistic knowledge about language changes, knowledge which represents a fundamental ingredient of a mechanism based on detecting and amplifying trends in language use.
Finally, in Chapter~6 I investigated a simplified model of momentum-based \emph{selection} in combination with an independent pressure for the \emph{innovation} of new variants.
While the importance of distinguishing between pressures of innovation and selection entailed by an evolutionary approach has been emphasized by other researchers on language change~\citep[particularly][]{Croft2000},
I hope to have demonstrated practically how this separation of concerns offers an explanation of both the \emph{universal} patterns found in language changes as well as the \emph{particular} nature of the sporadic and unpredictable actuation of individual changes.

The momentum-based trend amplification mechanism that formed the core of this thesis allows for the neutral but \emph{directed} selection of variants from the pool of synchronic variation, a pool whose internal distribution is heavily affected by functional motivations~\citep{Ohala1989}. This reconciliation of the functional origin of many language changes with their ultimately arbitrary selection and adoption by a community is summarised neatly by \citet{Labov2001} when he states that his comprehensive studies of sound changes

\begin{quote}
made it clear that linguistic change in progress is heavily constrained by the physical environment in which it takes place, and by structural factors that limit the course of change. At the same time, it is argued that the forces that move and motivate change, and are responsible for incrementation and transmission across generations, are largely social in nature.~(p.498)
\end{quote}

While this framework of thought is widely accepted within micro-level sociolinguistic work, I have argued that similar evolutionary approaches have not been fully adopted by the wider language change research community. The relevance of distinguishing universal asymmetries in innovation from those in selection was diminished by the lack of a concrete neutral selection mechanism that could account for the arbitrary selection of linguistic innovations without having to refer to concepts like sociolinguistic `prestige' which can only be attributed post-hoc.
I hope to have filled this conceptual gap in the evolutionary, two-step model of language change with the momentum-based selection mechanism, a candidate mechanism which can sporadically trigger a population to adopt linguistic innovations. The dynamics of the model exhibit directed transitions that are indicative of the selection of the incoming variants, irrespective of whether the innovations are actually functionally superior to (or simply neutral with respect to) the existing variants.

%While this might seem to rule it out as one of the  candidate mechanisms for selection mentioned by Labov,
While Labov speaks of ``largely social'' forces that move and motivate actual language changes, I have presented momentum-based selection as a highly \emph{mechanistic} pressure in this thesis.
%which makes no explicit reference to social groups
This is not to say that the two types of mechanism are necessarily contradictory, or that they are even distinct.
%Having established that the predictions made by selection based on trend amplification offers a promising explanation of the dynamics of language change
The apparent disconnect between the two should not be regarded as an unbridgable gap, but rather as an opportunity for research into whether much arbitrary-seeming social variation could in fact be reduced to a more mechanistic explanation such as the one presented in this thesis,
and thus maybe even provide a mechanistic \emph{grounding} for the concept of sociolinguistic prestige.

% the social and mechanistic might not in fact coincide.
For example, the sociolinguistic literature has seen repeated claims about specific speaker groups~(in particular females as well as the more `socially mobile' middle classes, see e.g.~\citealt[p.501]{Labov2001}) to be leading linguistic change, at least as far as the primarily available data from language changes in Western societies is concerned. While this pattern has already been proposed to reflect a relatively greater stake in the `social marketplace' of linguistic conventions by those groups, the momentum-based selection mechanism raises the question of whether an increased sensitivity to changes could not just have to do with social status, but could also be explained due to those individuals' position in their social network which allows them a better overview of the state of language (as well as current linguistic `trends') in their community. A comparison between the stratified diffusion of language changes through real social communities with the predictions made by momentum-based selection in structured social networks
could yield further insights into the relevance of such mechanisms.

% In-depth knowledge about how language changes roll out through communities is currently largely limited to data from Western societies, and even within this limited scope there are no uncontestable patterns, or at least they cannot be explained unambiguously/straightforwardly. females leading?

Rather than simply contribute another model of language change to aid the field take a step towards some well-defined goal post on its course to `explaining' language change, I hope that my review of the diverse accounts and approaches to language change in Chapter~\ref{ch:review} has succeeded in pointing out that there are in fact wildly differing opinions on the position of these very goal posts. I argued that different subfields of language change research are concerned with explaining very different aspects of change, from the emergence of language universals over probabilistically predictable socio-culturally influenced features to the unpredictability of particular, idiosyncratic changes.
In trying to adjust and unify the position of the goal posts, by pointing out the complementary nature of the approaches when viewed in an evolutionary framework, I also hope to have raised awareness regarding the scientific end goal for a theory of language change as an area of research that straddles the social and historical sciences~\citep{Blute1997}. In line with \citeauthor{Weinreich1968}'s original formulation of the \emph{actuation problem}~\citeyearpar{Weinreich1968}, I have argued that a complete theory of language change should not just be limited to correctly predicting the predictable aspects of the phenomenon, but also provide an explicit account or explanation of the \emph{unpreditable} nature of language change.\index{actuation problem}

While in thesis I have chiefly focussed on computational modelling as a tool for scientific enquiry, I hope to have highlighted the need for more empirical, particularly \emph{quantitative} research into how language changes actually unfold in communities, as well as how different individuals participate in language changes over time.
%More and more reliable data is necessary to test the concrete empirical predictions made my mathematical and computational models, without which they are of only very limited value to linguistic thinking.
Although I have brought forward theoretical arguments for why a replicator-neutral selection mechanism such as momentum-based selection can go a long way in explaining both the universal patterns of language changes as well as the constant diversification of languages, there is still much need for empirical evidence for such a mechanism. Particularly on the micro-level of the individual, the nature of sociolinguistic knowledge in the individual is just becoming a focus of research, and much new evidence on this matter can be expected in the coming years from work within the framework of perceptual dialectology as well as from experimental methods such as the one used by~\citet{Drager2011}.
% as well as in terms of the (under-)specification of its cross-linguistic predictions on the macro-level.

On the macro-level of historical changes and the cross-linguistic comparison of similar changes, I have pointed out a divergence in research goals as well as a relative lack of cumulative work within any unified framework. In Section~\ref{sec:tworates} I argued that different researchers have approached the quantitative question of the \emph{rate of language change} on two very different levels, where work in diachronic typology~\citep[such as][]{Bickel2015} is interested in the probability of a certain type of change to occur on a macro-level, whereas traditional historical linguistic work hones in on the speed with which a particular change diffuses through a population.\index{rates of change}
While there has generally been much talk of adaptation and selection in language change, quantitative evaluations of how much the selection of linguistic structures actually plays a role within particular historical changes has been minimal, as I argued in Section~\ref{sec:scurves}.

With respect to the cross-linguistic actuation probabilities of similar changes, the evolutionary approach to language change shows that the synchronic prevalence or preference of certain linguistic structures does not necessarily have to do with them being selected for based on their adaptive features. Instead, I hope to have demonstrated that many asymmetries in language change, including the unidirectional patterns found in domains ranging from sound change to grammaticalisation, might instead be due to the preferred innovation of specific variants. Separate from these asymmetries in the \emph{direction} of language changes due to innovation, I showed how selection mechanisms based on social learning, such as the trend-amplification dynamics of momentum-based selection, can yield \emph{directed} transitions that, while superficially indicative of an asymmetry between variants, is however only temporary and emergent from the dynamics of social learning.
%Combining the two mechanisms of innovation and selection we can therefore reaffirm an insight gained from the study of biological evolution, namely that the apparent prevalence of changes that can be construed as adaptive does not necessarily imply that the selection and spread of those traits is based on their adaptiveness.
