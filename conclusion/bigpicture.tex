This thesis has zoomed in on one particular pressure. The aim of this chapter is to situate the pressure in relation to other mechanisms that are involved in language change, as well as provide theoretical motivations for why momentum could (and should) be relevant for language change research.

\section{Competing motivations in linguistic change}



% From Anderson to Bickel
%\citep{Sundgren2009,Wichmann?}

historical contingency~\citep[p.503]{Labov2001} % Gould?

\section{Language change and replicator-neutrality}

% arbitrariness
% directed variation + directional selection
\citet{Sapir1921}'s `drift': languages do not just diverge when there is social pressure to discriminate, but also have an internal `drive' to change (in place) by themselves (p.160).

\citep[ch.7-12]{Labov2010} on forks in the road etc.

challenging the notion that ``a reliance on chance deprives an account of any real explanatory value" \citep[p.44]{Joseph2013}.

\section{Neutral selection of non-random variation}

Evolang: not \emph{easier to learn} but \emph{more likely to be invented}

% cf. "the prevalence of a particular species in a habitat does not necessarily imply that is it any better adapted to that habitat than its competitors"~\citep[p.2]{Blythe2012copying}

% biology: \citep{Gerlee2015}
