\chapter[Asymmetric generation of variants]{Competing selection pressures and the generation of linguistic variants}

% This thesis has zoomed in on one particular pressure. The aim of this chapter is to situate the pressure in relation to other mechanisms that are involved in language change, as well as provide theoretical motivations for why momentum could (and should) be relevant for language change research.

\section{Competing motivations in linguistic change}

% From Anderson to Bickel
%\citep{Sundgren2009,Wichmann?}

historical contingency~\citep[p.503]{Labov2001} % Gould?

\section{Language change and replicator-neutrality}

% arbitrariness
% directed variation + directional selection
\citet{Sapir1921}'s `drift': languages do not just diverge when there is social pressure to discriminate, but also have an internal `drive' to change (in place) by themselves (p.160).
