In its opening chapters, this thesis started off with a very general overview of the myriad `pressures' and `biases' that have been proposed to influence language change. Chapter~\ref{ch:momentummodel} proposed a new pressure to be added to the pool of established ones, with Chapter~\ref{ch:questionnaire} adding to the existing empirical evidence that a momentum-based approach is indeed a viable candidate like other previously proposed pressures.

Having zoomed in on one particular pressure, this final chapter is intended to `zoom out' again to help situate the idea of momentum-based selection relative to other mechanisms that are involved in language change, as well as connect it to previous thinking in the literature. % situate it in its historical context
The goal is to draw the many pressures that were touched upon back together in a systematic way, to form a more wholesome, if more complex, picture of language change. As this is a complex issue, I will approach it from four different sides: Section~\ref{sec:competingmotivations} discusses the idea of \emph{competing pressures} and how it has been treated in the literature, as well as provide theoretical motivations for why momentum could (and should) be relevant for language change research. % TODO also Bickel stuff?

In order to get a more systematic grip on the `pressures' alluded to throughout this thesis, Section~\ref{sec:wrightfisher} will introduce the \emph{Wright-Fisher model} of biological evolution and investigate it using the Markov model toolkit that was already used in Section~\ref{markovmodel}. The main purpose of this is to allow us to study a toy model of the dynamics and interaction of two basic pressures that can be incorporated into it, namely \emph{mutation} and \emph{selection}. Having covered the basics of the Wright-Fisher model, Section~\ref{sec:asymmetricmutation} will provide an extension that implements a momentum-based selection bias.

Finally, Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} will provide an overall summary and conclusion of the thesis, as well as a look forward on future work.

\label{sec:competingmotivations}
So far, the pressures were presented as directly set up against each other. But, partly in order to cope with the problem of \emph{actuation}, \index{actuation problem} scholars have already considered the interaction between them.

\subsection{Relating the pressures}

\citet{Bickel2015}: very specific effects can be studied *without* having to rule out all the intervening effects that you find in such an exceedingly complex phenomenon such as language

% does this mean that language always has a reason to move in many different directions? why is it ever standing still then?

\citet{Sundgren2009}: The varying influence of social and linguistic factors on language stability and change

\citet{Wichmann2015}: Diachronic stability and typology (\citet{Nichols2003} chapter from earlier version of same handbook?)

historical contingency~\citep[p.503]{Labov2001} % Gould?

Ok so if there's already so much work on different pressures, why should we need momentum-based selection? Apart from the empirical reasons (which still need plenty of filling in), there are also theoretical reasons why we should \emph{a priori} prefer a mechanism like momentum-based selection over functional ones.

\subsection{Language change, arbitrariness and replicator-neutrality}

% arbitrariness
% directed variation + directional selection
\citet{Sapir1921}'s `drift': languages do not just diverge when there is social pressure to discriminate, but also have an internal `drive' to change (in place) by themselves (p.160).

\citep[ch.7-12]{Labov2010} on forks in the road etc.

challenging the notion that ``a reliance on chance deprives an account of any real explanatory value" \citep[p.44]{Joseph2013}.

\subsection{Neutral selection of non-random variation}

Evolang: not \emph{easier to learn} but \emph{more likely to be invented}
