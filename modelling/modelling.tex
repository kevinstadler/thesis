\section{Why model?}

Within the field of language evolution (here meant to encompass both research on the evolution of the human language capacity, as well as modelling of the type of cultural, linguistic changes described above), computational models have undergone pronounced trends. % hype phase
During the hayday of computational modelling, the field first produced a plethora of qualitative and quantitative models of the evolution of the language faculty~\citep{Kirby1999,Nowak2001a} as well as the emergence of linguistic conventions, such as the `Naming Game'~\citep{Baronchelli2008}. Around the same time, similar methodologies became popular to study the dynamics of language \emph{change}, i.e.~the replacement of already established conventions, both in general~\citep{Niyogi1995,Niyogi1997,Arita1998,Nettle1999,Kataoka2000,Livingstone2000,Ritt2004,DeOliveira2005,Niyogi2006,Wedel2006,Baxter2006,Wedel2007,Ettlinger2007b,Ettlinger2007,Fagyal2010,Blythe2012,Gong2012,Otero-Espinar2013,Soskuthy2013,Pierrehumbert2014,Enke2016,Kauhanen2015} as well as for some specific historical changes in particular~\citep{Yang2002,Choudhury2006,Choudhury2007,Pearl2007,Troutman2008,Baxter2009,Sonderegger2010,Swarup2012,Ritt2012,Kirby2013,Kirby2013cogsci}.

In terms of external contributions to the study of language change, mathematicians and physicists in particular have brought the formal tools from their own domains to bear on questions of interest to linguists~\citep{Castellano2009,Blythe2015}. Given the complexity of the methods involved, such contributions often fail to have a lasting impact on thinking in the field if they do not form part of a broader linguistically-motivated research programme which makes it accessible to linguists. % Since one such research programme will be presented in-depth in Chapter~\ref{ch:modelling} which also discusses the role of modelling more generally, I will limit myself here to an overview of conceptually motivated proposals from within the field of language change~(as well as cultural change more generally).
Given the relatively abrupt rise of this new methodology, it is not surprising that this hype was followed by several meta-scientific and review papers advocating and/or defending the use of computational models~\citep{Cangelosi2002,Wang2004,DeBoer2006,Baker2008,Jaeger2009,Hruschka2009,Vogt2010,DeBoer2012EvoLang,Smith2016}.
Since most parts of this thesis are going to be concerned with computational modelling, it is worth asking: what \emph{is} the point of having a computational model?

The primary advantage of a formal model is that it allows~(or rather forces) one to step away from pure arm-chair theorising, which can be difficult to treacherous when applied to complex phenomena such as languages, which are affected by the interplay of many interacting parts or language users. Instead of guessing at the effects of micro-level assumptions on the macro-level dynamics of the system, a computational approach forces the researcher to explicitly lay out their assumptions about the individual, interacting parts in a quantitatively measurable (and ideally also well-motivated) way. From there, computational methods take the lead by determining in an objective way how the transparent assumptions about individual behaviour culminate in (potentially) complex interactional phenomena in the population.

Probably the earliest example of computational work on the emergence of communication systems is the so-called \emph{Naming Game}~\citep{Steels1995,Steels1998naminggame,Baronchelli2006}.\index{Naming Game}
In its simplest form a population of agents, each starting off with an empty lexicon, has to come to agree on a unique `name'~(linguistic form) for a referent or speech act. In-depth study of the Naming Game and its dynamics showed not only how a population could come to agree on a shared convention in the absence of any centralised coordination, it also helped shed light on the types of linguistic preferences or mechanisms that individual agents should have to enable de-centralised coordination to unfold seamlessly~\citep{Wellens2012,Spike2016}. 
Crucially, given the very simple problem description of the minimal version of the Naming Game which lacks any risk of referential ambiguity, its outcome is predicted \citep[and in some cases even proven][]{DeVylder2006,Skyrms2010} to be the emergence of a stable communication system. In the absence of any noise or stochasticity, this simple model does not exhibit continuous, ongoing change that is so characteristic of human language. %that would make it a complex adaptive system par excellence. %Rather, early investigations like the naming game provided a simple baseline dynamic on which further research could be built.

Going beyond the initial emergence of a symbolic communication system and closer to more realistic cases of language change under noisy transmission conditions,
\citet{Wedel2004,Wedel2006} offered a computational investigation of how simple mechanisms of replication can lead to, amongst other things, phonological category formation as well as contrast maintenance through change in the phonetic dimension. Inspired by models of evolutionary pressures taken from biology, the models were again chiefly a study of general mechanisms from which the aforementioned universal dynamics of language organisation emerged. When idiosyncratic factors or triggers of particular changes were concerned, such as in the study of contrast maintenance under the threat of contrast loss in~\citet{Wedel2006}, the sudden onset of contrast loss in one dimension is again applied externally, falling outside the scope of the theory of general, universal mechanisms that forms the basis of demonstrably adaptive changes whose actuation is reactive to an external trigger.

While computational modelling has also become a standard technique in related empirical fields such cognitive science, the models of individual behaviour that are of interest to psychologists are necessarily of a very different character than the multi-agent models typically employed to study language as a distributed population-level phenomenon.
The differences between the fields are not just limited to the \emph{types} of models though, they also extend to the exact goals of modelling and consequently to how models are evaluated.
While cognitive models are often assessed on a quantitative basis~\citep{Busemeyer2010}, many models of language evolution and change have retained a \emph{proof of concept} like character. This tradition harks back to original work on the evolution of shared communication systems~\citep{Steels1995,Kirby2000} where models are primarily judged based on their exhibiting some \emph{qualitative} feature such as compositionality, rather than by quantitative comparison to other models or to empirical data.
This development can be attributed to the often close~\citep[and sometimes confusing;][]{Haspelmath2016} interlacing of questions regarding the evolution of \emph{Language}, in the sense of the language \emph{capacity}, the emergence of universal features of languages~(such as duality of patterning) by cultural evolution, as well as evolutionary approaches to `mere' language \emph{change}, possibly in combination with the lack of established corpora of historical changes mentioned previously.

The promise that explicitly spelling out the quantitative assumptions of different models would bring clarity to the field is consequently not as straightforward as it might seem. Depending on the precise framing of the same phenomenon, such as the establishment of a shared communication system in the case of the Naming Game, or the emergence of compositional language from repeated interactions, superficially different mechanisms which actually have very similar effects on a behavioural level can be considered competing explanations for years~\citep{Wellens2012,Spike2016}.
Especially when models are explicitly dedicated to comparing the effect of different parameter settings \emph{within} them, the general dynamics (such as the basic learning rules or other parameters like population turnover employed in virtually every social learning model) are often taken for granted, although it is important to note that much of the dynamics are implicit in these basic assumptions themselves.
Without a dedicated effort to replicate existing models and bring them in direct relation to each other, even computational models can run risk of becoming ideological `blackboxes', counter to their original intention to make underlying assumptions more transparent.
The rhetoric with which computational models are presented can further aggravate this situation. Particularly when it is of interest to make computational models more appealing and convincing to the non-modeller, as is the case when the methodology first spreads to a new field, efforts to portray models as a tool for revelation and enlightenment (rather than as obfuscating black magic) run the risk of trivialising either the models themselves, or at least the analyses presented. %~(the latter point will be made clear with an example in Section~\ref{sec:realigriffiths})
%Computational models thus allow us to both directly compare the expected macro-level behaviour of an interacting system under different micro-level assumptions, but also to explicitly test different parameter conditions of the same model to determine the respective influence of different biases or model parameters.

The computational models which have stood the test of time are therefore those which are not one-offs, such as many of the early models which employed bespoke ad-hoc learning rules that are often not grounded in the general learning literature, but models which have undergone intense study and analysis from the ground up. For the case of the evolution of novel inventions, the Naming Game is a case in point~\citep{Baronchelli2008}. For the case of language \emph{change}, i.e.~the continuous replacement of established conventions, probably the most extensive and well-explored model is the Utterance Selection Model~(USM) of language change, which forms the basis of most of the modelling work in this thesis.

%It is with these words of caution in mind that we dive into an in-depth analysis of the (very) basic dynamics of two models

%\section{A conclusion on modelling}

\section{Trend-amplification and momentum-based selection}

The literature summarised above in Chapter~\ref{ch:review} as well as the pressures investigated in this chapter cover the bulk of the established accounts and theories about language change.
While the direct comparison of different pressures in the Utterance Selection Model just recapitulated indicates that an asymmetry between variants is necessary to account for the directed trajectories found in language change, a survey of the literature shows that there is no universal agreement on where exactly those asymmetries should be found. Adaptive pressures, most of which can be characterised as being language-internal, provide good explanations of the macro-level patterns of language change found cross-linguistically, but they are subject to a methodological flaw known as the \emph{actuation problem}. \index{actuation!actuation problem}
While general, universal pressures can be invoked to account for universal properties of human languages, they fail to explain why some linguistic features are only selected for occasionally in specific languages, thus leading to the actuation of particular language changes.
In other words, none of the selection mechanisms investigated so far offer a theory of how asymmetries could emerge spontaneously and sporadically, as appears to be the case in language change.
The remainder of this thesis is dedicated to the exploration of a relatively novel selection pressure that was briefly alluded to previously, namely that of \emph{trend amplification} by the individual. In the spirit of an exhaustive model comparison, the next chapter will investigate the dynamics of such a mechanism, implemented as a \emph{momentum-based} selection pressure within the Utterance Selection Model.
