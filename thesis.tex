\chapter{Acknowledgments}

Only a few years ago I would have cringed at the idea of writing an Acknowledgments section listing endless swathes of names, a taster of my obsession with change for the sake of change that you can spend the next 300~pages reading about if you like.

I guess it's only appropriate to start by thanking the people responsible for the fact that the thing in front of you is actually finished: over the past four years my supervisors Simon, Kenny and Richard (and not to forget adjunct supervisor Jenny) showed absolutely no mercy with my impatience at my own work as well as my curiosity and eagerness to move on to other topics. It was a real joy to be supervised by them, and also to witness the copious amounts of concordant swearing that no one knew could emanate from such a group of authority and which no doubt helped much to keep me on track.

For providing a stimulation athmosphere to work in I want to thank all members of the LEC/CLE, in particular my PhD cohort (Matt, Mark and James) who 

my nemesis Yasamin Motamedi

Of all the other postgrads that I had the joy of sharing room 1.15 with a special shoutout goes out to my collaborator and future business partner Elyse Jamieson. Not only were they responsible for the collection of much of the data discussed in Chapter~\ref{ch:shetland}, I also have to thank them for tolerating my attempts at writing emails in Scots, generally keeping up the craic and all the money we're gonna be making together.

I might have learnt most from learning and reading around outside the core of my subject, as a consequence I am deeply indebted to the many reading groups at Edinburgh that have tolerated me over the years (in particular the Language Variation and Change research group as well as the Sociolinguistics and Historical Phonology reading groups) and all their members, also my former collagues at the AI lab of the VUB, all the friends I made at the various LOT schools and of course the SFI Complex Systems Summer School in 2013, in particular Bruno Pace, as well as everyone else who I feel academically indebted to and whose legacy I hope to continue (Joachim de Beule deserves special mention here).

This is probably a good point to acknowledge all the people who, while not accompanying us on the journey, manage to send us off in a direction with a kick in the bum so forceful that we still find ourselves moving in that general direction years down the line: at the start of most anyone's curiosity stand teachers who manage to convey topics in a gripping way, and it is a fact that I wouldn't be anywhere near where I am today if I hadn't taken Hans Christian Lusch√ºtzky's introduction to Indo-European at the University of Vienna many (many) years ago. %Harald Neuhold

Moving back into the immediate present, I would like to thank my writing pal Rachael, even though she utterly failed to teach me any Geordie at all, as well as fellow INTJ Vanessa for thesis writeup therapy and sharing my obsession with the New Mexican desert, amongst many other things. (Oh and this entire thesis basically started off from a paper that she once name-dropped in one of our PhD supervisions in my first year. No biggie.)

Who would be more deserving of a special mention than co-PhD, desk sharer, yoga instructor, band mate, therapist, travel companion, fellow SHEEP and general 6-year-old Jasmeen. Much of this thesis was written in her presence at Black medicine on the Bruntsfield Links, who we are both most indebted to for providing us with heated office space.
%Without the nutritional input of the various Mosque Kitchens during my time in Edinburgh.

Last but not least I want to thank all the people who've made sure that all other aspects of life around me have always been a lot of fun. Megan, Theodora, Mote, Julia, Steffi.
Musical co-conspirators Kieran, my fellow sick kids of edinburgh (Max, Valerie and Doris), and Dani %(whose inability to finish things rivals my own, proof that we are twins after all)
the `uncountable' flatmates who've tolerated me over the years~(I've actually counted at least 53, which is the reason I'm not listing them here) as well as my two axolotls, T'Nealle and D'Brickashaw, for reminding me that I really shouldn't have pets after all, not even ones that are capable of regrowing their limbs.

, everyone that I've had really intense conversations with in the past two years, anyone who ever went flaneuring with me (on foot or bike), all the other people who kept me sane and, most of all, all those who drove me crazy.

\chapter{Questionnaire materials}
\label{app:questionnaire}
This appendix contains the various materials used for the questionnaire data collection and analysis: Section~\ref{app:paperquestionnaire} provides the four questionnaire sheets described in Chapter~\ref{ch:questionnaire} that were handed to participants on site, in all four randomisations~(16 pages total). The online version of the questionnaire is still available at \url{http://spellout.net/ibexexps/kstadler/shetland/experiment.html}, and the source code both for the IBEX online questionnaire as well as the generation of the randomised questionnaire sheets is provided in Section~\ref{app:questionnairecode}. Section~\ref{app:questionnairedatacode} provides the R code used to load and arrange the questionnaire and acceptability judgment data that form the basis of the statistical analyses in chapter~\ref{ch:questionnaire}.
