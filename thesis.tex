\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

Only a few years ago I would have cringed at the idea of writing an Acknowledgments section listing endless swathes of names, but here we go! (While this might be unremarkable for some, it's another one of those things that fuels my fascination with change for the sake of change, which you have the opportunity the spend the next 200 pages reading about.)

I guess it's only appropriate to start by thanking the people responsible for the fact that the thing in front of you is actually finished: over the past four years my supervisors Simon, Kenny and Richard (not to forget adjunct supervisor Jenny) showed absolutely no mercy with my impatience at my own work as well as my curiosity and eagerness to quickly move on to many other topics. It was a real joy to be supervised by them, and also to witness the copious amounts of concordant swearing which no doubt even further fortified their authority in my eyes, helping much to keep me on track.

For providing a stimulating atmosphere to work in I want to thank all members of the LEC/CLE, in particular my PhD cohort consisting of Matt, Mark and James who provided good and challenging company while they were around, and distant motivation once they had all left me behind the (presumably s-shaped) curve.
For fear of ultimate revenge I have to thank my nemesis Yasamin Motamedi -- if you see her roaming around DSB with an evil smile on her face in the near future it can only mean that the hardcopy of this thesis never made it to the college office and that I am in deep trouble. If not, she will receive her well-earned Dr.~Pepper or personalised Dutch class in due course.

Of all the other postgrads that I had the joy of sharing room~1.15 with I am particularly indebted to my collaborator and future business partner Elyse Jamieson who was not only in charge of collecting the data discussed in Chapter~\ref{ch:questionnaire}, I also have to thank them for tolerating my attempts at writing emails in Scots, generally keeping up the craic while enjoying crisps, and of course for all the money we're gonna be making together.

In contrast, I would like to thank my writing pal Rachael, despite the fact that she utterly failed to teach me any Geordie at all, as well as fellow INTJ Vanessa for thesis writeup therapy and sharing my obsession with the New Mexican desert, amongst many other things. (Oh and this entire thesis started off from a paper that she mentioned once in one of our PhD supervisions early on in my first year. No biggie.)

I might have gained most from learning and reading around outside the core of my subject, and as a consequence I am deeply indebted to the many interest groups at Edinburgh that have tolerated me over the years, in particular the Language Variation and Change research group as well as the Sociolinguistics and Historical Phonology reading groups, and all their members. My thinking was also much influenced by my former collagues at the AI~lab of the VUB, all the friends I made at the various LOT~schools and of course the SFI~Complex Systems Summer School in 2013, in particular Bruno Pace, as well as everyone else who I feel academically indebted to and whose legacy I hope to do justice to (Joachim De~Beule deserves special mention here).
%Gottfried, for teaching me about the ways of the nomadic academic.

This is probably a good point to acknowledge all the people who, while not accompanying us on the journey, manage to send us off in a direction by applying `a vector of energy to the rump' so forceful that we still find ourselves moving in that general direction years down the line. I owe this lyrical version of a well-known metaphorical image to Harald Neuhold, the first person that deserves being credited for this very reason: at the start of most anyone's curiosity stand teachers who manage to convey topics in a gripping way, and I certainly wouldn't be anywhere near where I am today if I hadn't taken Hans Christian Lusch√ºtzky's introduction to Indo-European (followed by several other courses) at the University of Vienna many (many) years ago.

For allowing me to continue moving in that general direction I want to thank my family, in particular my parents, as well as the \emph{Vienna University of Technology}, the Flemish \emph{Agentschap voor Innovatie door Wetenschap en Technologie}~(IWT) as well as the \emph{College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences}~(HSS) at The University of Edinburgh, all of which helped keep me well-fed all this time. (This is probably also a good point to acknowledge the various Mosque Kitchens around Edinburgh who've provided most of my nutritional input over the past few years.)

Last but not least I want to thank all the people who've made sure that all other aspects of life around me have always been a lot of fun. Particular victims in this regard, in approximate order of how much they've had to put up with my whining, are Megan, Theodora, Mote, Julia and Steffi.
For uplifting and distracting harmonic excursions I have to thank my many musical co-conspirators, including but not limited to Dr.~Kieran~J.~Curran, my fellow \emph{sick kids of edinburgh}~(Max, Valerie and Doris) as well as Dani.
Both eluding and transgressing any and all categories is co-PhD, desk sharer, yoga instructor, band mate, therapist, travel companion, fellow SHEEP and general 6-year-old Jasmeen. Large chunks of this thesis were written in her presence at Black medicine on the Bruntsfield Links, who we are both most indebted to for providing us with heated office space and a great soundtrack.

For making sure I've always had fun around the house I want to thank the `uncountable' flatmates who've entertained and tolerated me over the years~(I've actually counted at least~55, which is the reason I'm not listing them here) as well as my two axolotls, T'Nealle and D'Brickashaw, for reminding me that I really shouldn't have pets, not even if they're capable of regrowing any of their limbs that might go missing in action.
Thanks also to all those who I've knowingly or unknowingly omitted to name here, including everyone that I've had really \emph{intense} conversations with in the past few years, anyone who ever went flaneuring with me (whether on foot or bike), all the other people who kept me sane and, most of all, all those who drove me crazy.

\chapter{Questionnaire materials}
\label{app:questionnaire}
This appendix contains the various materials used for the questionnaire data collection and analysis: Section~\ref{app:paperquestionnaire} provides the four questionnaire sheets described in Chapter~\ref{ch:questionnaire} that were handed to participants on site. Only one randomisation is given. The online version of the questionnaire is still available at \url{http://spellout.net/ibexexps/kstadler/shetland/experiment.html}, and the source code both for the IBEX online questionnaire as well as the generation of the randomised questionnaire sheets is provided in Section~\ref{app:questionnairecode}.
% app:questionnairedata?
Section~\ref{app:questionnairedatacode} provides the R~code used to load and arrange the questionnaire and acceptability judgment data that form the basis of the statistical analyses in Chapter~\ref{ch:questionnaire}.
