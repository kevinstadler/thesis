\section{Defining language change}

Most every person that engages in communication, whether by talking or signing, is aware of the variation found in language. While linguistic communication is a central (if not defining) part of what makes us human, if we look at specific conventions such as sounds, words or grammatical patterns, we find vast variation in the different accents, dialects and languages within a community, across a country, or across the entire globe~\citep{Evans2009}.

The same variation has not always existed, nor did it come about through abrupt divine intervention, as the tale of the tower of Babel would suggest. Rather, linguistic diversity is the result of small incremental changes to a community's linguistic system which slowly accumulate over time, first within speakers, then across generations, until eventually descendants of the same linguistic community speak a variety that would be unintelligible to speakers from a few generations earlier.

Language itself is a complex phenomenon which can be approached and characterised in many different ways. While there is no single definition of what exactly language is that even a fraction of linguistic researchers would agree on, for the purposes of this thesis it will suffice to define language as the collection of learned, conventional behaviours % or system/or signs
that members of a given speech community use to communicate with each other. In its most general sense, language change then is any change to the makeup, distribution or usage frequency of or within this collection of conventions.

Aspects of linguistic conventions that have to be learned can be found at several levels of analysis, and languages undergo change at virtually all levels of description: the inventory of physical articulation gestures that form the basis of linguistic communication can change, whether by slightly altering the production of existing gestures in a continuous fashion, replacing or dropping them from the articulatory inventory, or through the introduction of new gestures and distinctions altogether. On the level of meaningful signs, i.e.~associations between articulation patterns and specific communicative functions, both sides of the association can undergo change, with the same articulation becoming associated to a different meaning, or otherwise the same meaning coming to be expressed using a different form. Going beyond simple meaningful associations, the morphosyntactic patterns in which a language augments or combines lexical items, such as word order conventions or complex inflectional patterns, can change as well.

While most humans are to some degree aware of the changes going on in their communities on many of these levels without the need for scientific measuring devices of any kind~\citep{Labov2001,Tagliamonte2012}, the systematic study of language changes has yielded not just many different approaches to capturing and describing changes, but also in many theories as to how the simple fact that languages undergo change at all should be~\emph{explained}.

\section{Explaining language change}

Like any empirical science, linguistics~(\emph{historical} linguistics in particular) is not just concerned with \emph{describing} natural social phenomena. The goal of scientific enquiry is to gather insights into how the phenomena at hand can be explained or accounted for, typically by making plausible claims as to their underlying mechanisms and testing falsifiable predictions made by those accounts against empirical data. Given the breadth of language change as defined above there is a substantial amount of literature on the topic, much of which is concerned with both the documentation of language changes as well as explanations for the changes at the same time.
In this Section, I will attempt to provide a structured, historical overview over the main strands of thinking about how language change is explained.
In doing so I will pay particular attention to an important fact that is not often acknowledged, namely that there are not just differences in the explanations themselves, but that there is no consensus on how~(and at what level) language change can or should be explained.

%factors and causes~\citep{McMahon1994?}

\subsection{Early accounts}

While the earliest descriptions of a language date almost as far back as the onset of the written historical record, documentation relating to language \emph{changes} are far more recent.
In the absence of recordings from earlier stages of a language, or a written record of any reasonable time depth, even a cunning linguist had little to work with in terms of a systematic study of language change. % beyond the fact that it happens
What was required to start investigations in any meaningful way was to make the inference that much of the synchronically attested dialectal variation was really a matter of variation that first occurred \emph{temporally} through local change, and which had then diffused across geographical space at different rates and in different directions~\citep{Chambers1998}.

While several earlier sources show that many disconnected scholars inferred this based on their study of ancient languages like Greek, Roman and Sanskrit,
the insight is today often credited to the orientalist~\citet[Sir William][]{Jones1799}, mainly due to the impact his particular publication had on the quickly expanding field of Indo-European studies. The diverse varieties of the then still to be established Indo-European language family, which covered (and still cover) almost the entirety of Europe's linguistic landscape, were already densely documented at the time, forming a perfect testbed for the emergent methodology of linguistic reconstruction.

%As soon as historical linguistics had moved from describing similarities between lexical items or morphosyntactic constructions to positing concrete sound correspondances based on the idea of the regularity of sound changes~\citep{Neogrammarians}, the first theories attempting to explain the correspondances, or rather the changes presumed to have lead to the later correspondances, arose.

First faced with the discovery of regular sound changes witnessed in the divergence of the Indoeuropean language family, the early Indo-europeanists shared the intuitive position presented above, expressing a certain puzzlement over why a perfectly working set of conventions (in this case phonetic realisations) should be replaced for no apparent reason, often forcing them to fall back on more creative `psychological' reasoning behind changes such as the Germanic consonant shift:

\begin{quote}
``By no means do I want to claim that this change occurred without any disadvantage, in some sense sound shifting appears to be barbarism which other, quieter people abstained from, but this has to do with the immense advancements and desire of freedom of the Germans [\ldots] they ventured into the innermost sounds of their language''~\citep[p.417, own translation]{Grimm1848}
\end{quote}

%Realising that such semi-intentional accounts, for example where phonetic changes are said to reflect underlying political ones, allow for too much leeway in
From such fanciful ad-hoc accounts which were merely limited by the creative abilities of the linguistic researcher,
explanations moved to the somewhat more accountable domain of physiological factors. Trying to account for the High German consonant shift, Grimm finds that ``experience teaches us that mountain air makes sounds sharp and rough, where the flat land makes them soft and dull''~(ibid, p.828), leading to a theory that traced the sound shift back to the increased expiration that befell the High German tribes as they settled in mountaineous regions. As more and more descriptions and evidence for similar changes across different languages began to accumulate, linguists started appealing to even more general, mechanistic explanations.
With the field still very much focussed on sound changes but before the advent of reliable tools for acoustic analysis, \citet{Jespersen1922} contemplated that

\begin{quote}
``at one moment, for some reason or other, in a particular mood, in order to lend authority or distinction to our words, we may happen to lower the jaw a little more, or to thrust the tongue a little more forward than usual, or inversely, under the influence of fatigue or laziness, or to sneer at someone else, or because we have a cigar or potato in our mouth, the movements of the jaw or of the tongue may fall short of what they usually are. We have all the while a sort of conception of an average pronunciation, of a normal degree of opening or of protrusion, which we aim at, but it is nothing very fixed, and the only measure at our disposal is that we are or are not understood.''~\citep[p.166]{Jespersen1922}
%Everyone thinks that he talks today just as he did yesterday, and, of course, he does so in nearly every point. But no one knows if he pronounces his mother-tongue in every respect in the same manner as he did twenty years ago. May we not suppose that what happens with faces happens here also? One lives with a friend day in and day out, and he appears to be just what he was years ago, but someone who returns home after a long absence is at once struck by the changes which have gradually accumulated in the interval.''
\end{quote}

While the particular depiction of what might today be thought of as underspecification or coarticulation effects is rather comical, the quote exemplifies a general trend in the field to abandon particular explanations for particular changes in favour of more general \emph{linguistic} pressures that apply across languages~\citep[see also][ch.21]{Bloomfield1933}. This period gave rise to what is probably the biggest framework for explaining changes whose legacy extends well into the present day, in what can be referred to as \emph{language-internal} accounts of change.

\subsection{Language-internal accounts}

The defining feature of language-internal accounts of change is that they explain the occurrence of changes based on an \emph{asymmetry} between the language states before and after the change that is \emph{internal} to the linguistic system and its acquisition. % could be general or language-specific
While there is no strict definition of exactly what makes an account language-internal, one finds several attempts to delineate the approach in the literature, e.g.~that ``specific changes are thought to be internally caused when there is no evidence for external causation, i.e.~for language contact''~\citep[p.366]{Luraghi2010}.
%While there are authors who argue that ``no empirical study so far carried out has actually demonstrated that sound change can arise spontaneously within a variety''~\citep[p.24]{Milroy1999}, i.e.~that there is no such thing as true internal change.
These accounts generally differ from earlier accounts by not attempting to ground language changes in non-linguistic features of their specific speaker groups, nor in other external inter-individual or political dynamics that form the basis of \emph{social accounts} to be discussed below.

In terms of the scientific treatment of language change, language-internal accounts signified a transition from the study of \emph{particular} changes to that of general, \emph{universal} principles of change. This move was primarily supported by the methodology of and results obtained from the systematic study of sound changes. On one hand, the success of the new dogma of the \emph{exceptionlessness} of sound changes indicated that language change was, at least on some level, rule-based. In terms of scientific thinking about language change, this suggested that it might be possible to discover the underlying mechanical principles of change, which would turn linguistics from a historical social science to one of more or less deterministic explanation like in the physical sciences~\citep{Sapir1929}.

The impression that it should be possible to move beyond the mere post-hoc description of changes to their prediction was not just due to the theoretical framework behind linguistic reconstruction, but also due to the empirical results obtained from the method. The systematic documentation of sound changes across many languages and language families revealed \emph{unidirectional} trends, the catalogisation of which forms part and parcel of any historical linguistics textbook until today~\citep[see e.g.][]{Campbell2013}. A prime example are changes in the realisation of phonemes which were copiously attested in one direction, but hardly the other, such as the frequent frication of voiceless stops, as opposed to the more unusual stopping of fricatives. While the identification of these universal \emph{asymmetries} was perceived as an improvement over the earlier ad-hoc accounts of individual changes, the lack of a well-defined framework for describing languages meant that researchers were left with a lot of leeway in how to classify individual changes so as to `explain' them as an instance of some generally observed tendency.

In a recursive manner, the observation of general trends or constraints on the \emph{direction} of changes gave rise to the postulation of general principles which were then invoked to explain the very changes they were derived from~\citep{Lass1980,Haspelmath2006}. While this approach certainly helped to identify paths that sound changes were unlikely %~\citep[although only arguably impossible][]{?}
to go down, the occurrence of individual changes could be `explained' by more or less arbitrarily picking from a broad inventory of likely changes that even included ones going in opposite directions, the processes of phonetic assimiliation and dissimilation being one example, a criticism that I will return to below.
%, both of which would be considered natural developments
%While some light was shed on the types of changes, the question of why exactly why what changes occurred was forgotten.

% TODO mention ethnographic work on language change as improvement/decay corresponding to civilisation states?

While the comparatively `simple' matter of sound change was often maintained to be due to the gradual \emph{accumulation of errors} in pronounciation already hinted at above~\citep[see e.g.][for a textbook account of the general principle]{Jespersen1949}, the rising interest in syntax during the advent of generativism also resulted in more precise theories of how syntactic changes unfold over time. While syntax constituted an arguably more complex domain of inquiry than phonetics or phonology, the basic idea of change as a matter of \emph{mislearning}, i.e.~failing to acquire the `correct' target convention from ones linguistic environment, was transferred from sound to morphosyntactic changes~\citep{Salmons2013}.
The main difference between the fields was that, with its underlying assumption of an idealised language capacity and particular focus on the \emph{language acquisition device}, generativist explanations sought mislearning mainly in children's acquisition of a language's syntactic rules. Given the purpose-specific nature and consequent presumed flawlessness of said acquisition device, child-based language change was largely explained to be due to changes in the `primary linguistic data' from which the device is meant to derive a language's underlying grammar.
%child-based language change~\citep[p.109]{Croft2006}

The relative ease with which categorical morphosyntactic changes could be described also gave rise to a large body of quantitative work related to grammatical parameter setting~\citep{Lightfoot1991} with concrete claims about its reliance on specific learning cues in linguistic data~\citep{Gibson1994}.
In contrast to earlier work on sound changes which still struggled with the lack of precise quantitative description of its subject matter, the exact description of specific cases of syntactic change as well as concrete postulated thresholds for the amount of external data required to correctly acquire their underlying grammars led to specific models that were meant to recapitulate specific historical changes~\citet[e.g.]{Yang2002}. % TODO this is really language contact, no?

It is interesting to note how the `success' or correctness of an \emph{explanation} of language change is evaluated in this approach.
Given that the causal triggering of the change is framed to be internal to the language, rather than due to some arbitrary external, historical factor, the particular language changes under investigation are more or less explicitly framed as inevitable, rather than accidental.
Whether the asymmetry is based on universal articulation biases or on changes to the learning data~(in particular the frequency of use of morphosyntactic constructions or lexical items, which are for some reason also often regarded as inevitable language-internal facts), an account~(and especially a quantitative model) of a specific change would be considered `wrong' if it failed to predict the occurrence of the change.
%~(more or less deterministically).

%As in interesting corollary, models of those 
The fact that there are many models that `successfully' predict the occurence of particular changes anticipates a criticism of language-internal accounts that will be elaborated on later namely that it is always possible to find some asymmetry between the competing language states that biases acquisition towards the later stage of the language.
While language-internal accounts appear to be in principle falsifiable, the fact that the methodology is geared towards the identification of successful particular explanations is not merely a theoretical concern~\citep{Lass1980}: the vast majority of published accounts aimed at identifying specific language-internal causes or triggers for a change do so `successfully',  predict changes~\citep[e.g.][among many others]{Niyogi1995,Yang2002,Ritt2012,VanTrijp2013}. While there are also publications which consider unsuccessful (competitor) models~\citep[e.g.][]{Sonderegger2010} or those which also consider a model successful even if it underdetermines the direction of changes to some degree~\citep[e.g.][]{Lau2016} these are the exception rather than the rule.
%Similar to concerns regarding confirmation bias in experimental work, one must assume that for every case where a certain factor is shown to correctly predict the occurence of a change, there is a much higher number of unreported cases where efficiency does not seem to affect change at all.
%with an important twist: it's historical, it can't be repeated.
While the construction of quantitative language-internal models of specific changes provides a precise account of the supposed underlying mechanisms responsible for those particular changes, it offers no generalisability beyond that one historical event. %While the study of sound change had already generalised its findings from particular change events to the general patterns that changes across the world appeared to follow, the study of lexical and morphosyntactic change followed suit.

\index{unidirectionality}\index{grammaticalisation}
In parallel to generative work focussed on explaining grammatical change as internal to syntax, cross-linguistic typological approaches to language change gave rise to an explanatory framework similar to that used in sound change. Similar to the directional tendencies that had been revealed to guide sound changes, the study of \emph{grammaticalisation} revealed a similar pattern where closed-group, bound grammatical morphemes can be traced back to formerly independent lexical items with specific referential content~\citep{Hopper1993}.
%Jespersen's \emph{negation cycle} 
In contrast, barely any examples of the development of (bound)~grammatical morphemes becoming standalone lexical items can be found across the world's languages~(English~`ish' being one of the rare exceptions).
This apparent \emph{irreversibility} of grammaticalisation~\citep{Haspelmath2004directionality} lent support to a new set of universal asymmetries due to the unidirectionality of both semantic and phonetic erosion that is thought to guide morphosyntactic changes. The eternal cycle of wear of morphosyntactic material and consequent need for replenishment implied by grammaticalisation theory also fit neatly with the universal circular nature of language changes that had arisen in more descriptive level work by typologists~\citep{Cowgill1963,Hodge1970}.

While the various approaches to language change listed here come from very different approaches and cover very different aspects of language change, 
the emerging unifying principle of language-internal explanations is the conceptually similar approach of accounting for changes in a \emph{mechanistic} way due to them being based on some \emph{inherent asymmetry}, either between competing linguistic variants, or between the language state before and after the change. In all cases the acquisition or use of the original language state is assumed to be prone to actually acquire or perform the target state. Exactly how this asymmetry is framed depends mostly on the particular theoretical approach taken, ranging from talk about \emph{pressures}~\citep[e.g.][]{Thomsen2006}, a nod towards deterministic explanation in the natural sciences, over \emph{motivations}~\citep{MacWhinney2014} and \emph{preferences}~\citep{Fedzechkina2016} in psychologically-grounded work, all the way to \emph{biases}, the latter term used both generally as well as in reference to learning and inference frameworks in particular.
Putting forward such a mechanistic language-internal account for a particular historical change often implies that that change was in some sense inevitable, an approach to explaining -- in the sense of deterministically predicting -- the occurrence of specific changes that is still most widespread today in the domain of morphosyntactic changes~\citep{Lightfoot2010}.

In the study of sound change, equally, mechanistic error-based accounts continue to be popular~\citep[see e.g.][who make specific reference to the importance of \emph{asymmetries} between phonetic variants to explain change]{Garrett2013}, %~\citep[see e.g.]{Beddor2009}
now encompassing not just phonetic changes but also exhibiting an increasing interest in how \emph{phonologisation} of formerly non-segmental features gives rise to novel phonemic contrasts~\citep[e.g.][]{Kirby2013}.

While providing insight into the ways and trajectories in which languages change, language-internal accounts have long been criticised for underspecifying \emph{when} changes occur, a conceptual and scientific issue that has come to be known to historical linguists as the \emph{actuation problem}. But before turning to the actuation problem, I will turn to language-internal accounts' bigger and bolder modern sibling, the idea of characterising language as a \emph{complex adaptive system}.

%The increasing availability of individual changes and their particular explanations and patterns across them led

%``How can speakers be masters of pronunciation change in one area but helpless victims in other cases?''~\citep[p.192]{Ohala1989}

\subsection{Competing motivations and language as a complex adaptive system}
\label{sec:lcas}\index{competing motivations}\index{pressures!competing pressures}\index{complex adaptive system}

The turn towards novel research methods and quest for generalisations across languages has seen the rise of a new research moniker that frames \emph{language as a complex adaptive system}~(\emph{LCAS} for short). This general term provides a catchy name for a wide range of branches of linguistic research which do not share a common methodology or evaluation criteria. Rather, it covers approaches within specific fields that acknowledge the important role of competing factors from a variety of sources~(cognitive, physical or social) while stressing the fact that languages are continuously adapting based on the needs and requirements of everyday language use in interaction~\citep{LCAS2009}. Just as the transition from early ad-hoc accounts to more theoretically motivated language-internal explanations was gradual, there is also no clear divide between the LCAS approach and language-internal accounts, many of which also developed an interest in the intricate interactions of competing motivations in language change~\citep{Berg1998,Thomsen2006,MacWhinney2014}.
%In the exposition of the different accounts of and explanations for language change so far, the pressures were presented as directly set up against each other. But, partly in order to tackle the problem of actuation, scholars have already considered the interaction between different, \emph{competing} pressures.
Crucially, when it comes to the study of language \emph{change} as a natural outcome of language's continuous adaptation, the approach shares with language-internal accounts that its focus is explicitly on the \emph{universal} patterns and direction of change~\citep[p.4-5]{LCAS2009}.

Rather than representing a tight methodological framework, LCAS also stands for an openness towards novel and experimental tools to further our understanding of language use and change, in particular approaches that go beyond explanations that could be based on mere `arm chair reasoning'. In order to get to grip with the kinds of dynamics implied by the word `complex', mathematical and particularly computational modelling became a popular tool to investigate emerging and evolving communication systems. Since the entirety of Chapter~\ref{ch:modelling} is dedicated to both the topic of modelling in general as well as replications of some specific models, I will for now focus on the results obtained from empirical research that is thought to speak to the adaptive nature of linguistic changes.

\subsubsection{Inferring universal pressures from cross-linguistic data}

While diachronically-minded linguists have long been grouping and categorising similar changes to uncover general trends in the paths taken by language change, typologists have arrived at a similar point but from the opposite direction. Based on comparative work on the synchronic distribution of linguistic features such as~\citet{Greenberg1963}, the preponderance of individual features~(or co-occurrence of features) was taken as evidence for some sort of adaptive advantage to those features or feature constellations~\citep{Haspelmath2008}.

In line with LCAS principles, the adaptive pressures are assumed to be associated with language \emph{use}, which would over time influence the development of languages and consequent distribution of grammatical properties across the world.
One contrast between such typological approaches and traditional language-internal accounts is the assumed \emph{specificity} of the pressures that are thought to steer language change. While language-internal accounts often refer to linguistic concepts and mechanisms that are theory- or language-specific, typological work typically works with much more \emph{descriptive} measures that lend themselves to cross-linguistic comparison~\citep{Haspelmath2010}.

Rather than embodying a simple, qualitative asymmetry between specific competing variants, typological pressures are typically described in \emph{quantitative} terms. 
For example, \citet{Zipf1935,Zipf1949} popularised~(and sought to explain) the finding that, across many languages, the frequency of a word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table of all words of that language.
Having such a distribution is indicative of some sort of optimisation since, if more frequently used words are shorter, the average length of signalling decreases overall. While it has since been shown experimentally that individuals will preferentially produce abbreviated forms when it is more effective in information-theoretic terms~\citep{Mahowald2013,Kanwal2017}, a bias for the selective propagation of changes towards such advantageous forms through larger speech communities has not been demonstrated yet.

An early example of a general, quantative pressure whose effect was postulated to affect change directly is that of a phoneme's \emph{functional load}~\citep{Martinet1955}. The phoneme, typically defined to be the largest non-meaning-bearing unit of linguistic analysis, gains its function as a linguistic category by providing meaning distinctions at the higher level of \emph{combinatorially created} meaningful signals, or \emph{morphemes}. In this way, a phoneme owes its existence to linguistic items at a higher level of organisation which allow it to stand in contrast to other phonemes, typically in the form of lexical minimal pairs. In the absence of any such minimal pairs, upholding a phonemic contrast is inefficient in the sense that it would move the lexicon away from being a productive system built on re-using a limited set of signals towards an unstructured inventory of individual holistic lexical items, with as many distinct articulation gestures in the language as there are morphemes~\citep{Spike2017}.
In practice, however, it is possible to find several minimal pairs for most pairs of phonemes in any given human language. Combining this observation with studies of the reorganisation of sound systems, especially the \emph{merger} or \emph{contrast loss} of formerly distinct phonemes, led \citet{Martinet1955} to propose that a phoneme's \emph{functional load}, i.e.~the amount of contrastive function it performs at the level of the lexicon, would have an influence on whether or not it would be maintained as a contrastive element relative to other phonemes. The concept fits well under the modern LCAS umbrella, seeing as it is describes a delicate trade-off between competing pressures of reducing the number of distinct signals maintained by a language against the pressure of keeping distinct phonemes to allow combinatorial signalling to occur at all. While the direct link between number of minimal pairs and contrast maintenance has since seen confirmation based on population-level diachronic data~\citep{Wedel2013short}, the question of whether the observed pattern satisfies some externally-optimal equilibrium or whether it is simply based on the peculiarities of individual human phonemic acquisition still needs to be addressed~\citep{Spike2017}.

More recently, theories speaking to the efficient organisation of language have also taken a firm hold in thinking about linguistic structures and inventories at other levels.
Based on the functional typology work referred to above, the availability of large-scale syntactic corpora has allowed quantitative investigations into the syntactic organisation of languages based on actual usage data, rather than abstract principles of syntactic description. In particular, studies of the average syntactic dependency length of data for various languages, which is taken as a measure of an utterance's processing complexity, have revealed that many of the correlations between constituency orders for different syntactic constructions can be explained based on simple preferences or biases towards efficient processing~\citep{Futrell2015} or language `utility'~\citep{Jaeger2010}.

While the pressures investigated in all these approaches are typically motivated by general cognitive principles at the level of the individual, most of the evidence for their existence is gathered at the very macro-level, often from cross-linguistic data, where those biases are thought to have expressed themselves over time. The question of whether (and how) individual biases become manifest in languages on the inter-individual population level is itself a non-trivial question~\citep{Kirby1999}. The necessity to go beyond macro-level descriptive data to address this question has long been recognised, and given rise to an experimental framework in the LCAS spirit, known as \emph{iterated learning}.

%All these accounts assume an internally stable, consistently acquired language whose stability is broken by external perturbation. But in the absence of any external triggers for the reorganisation of a linguistic system, what are the odds of `eternal optimisation' of a language~\citep{Boersma2003}?

%concrete empirical work is particularly focussed on \emph{universal} pressures, or at least on pressures that can to some extent be generalised cross-linguistically.
%In the same way that sound changes, given that it is motivated by macro-level typological work, such as the statistical universals documented by~\citet{Greenberg1963}.

\subsubsection{Universal pressures and the Iterated Learning Model}
\index{iterated learning}
\label{sec:ilm}

As the name suggests, the Iterated Learning Model~(ILM for short) actually started off as a computational model, primarily to investigate the question of innate biases related to the compositionality of human languages~\citep{Kirby2000,Brighton2002,Kirby2002}. Counter the idea of a strongly innate language capacity that had been dominating most thinking about morphosyntax since Chomsky's `poverty of the stimulus' argument, these first computational efforts at modelling the emergence of languages %beyond the simple lexica of the naming game
suggested that weak, domain-general biases in the individual were enough to yield strong linguistic universals at the population level when learning and production were \emph{iterated}, i.e.~repeated over generations of learners~\citep{Kirby2004}.

While the iterated learning paradigm has undergone gradual transformation in its scope and goals since these early models~(to the point of encompassing any and all experiments or models of repeated communication according to some definitions, see \citealt{Scott-Phillips2010}, Box~3), one aspect that still features strongly in most of the model's incarnations is the \emph{bottleneck}.
The original conception of the role of the bottleneck was that limiting the amount of data learners received would force them to generalise from the limited data they received, causing linguistic signalling systems to become more \emph{structured} through repeated production and learning. The effectiveness of the bottleneck was first shown in computational simulations to lead to the emergence of compositionality~\citep{Kirby2000} as well as recursion~\citep{Kirby2002}, and its role in triggering the emergence of compositionality was later confirmed experimentally with human participants in controlled laboratory experiments~\citep[e.g.][]{Kirby2008,Cornish2009,Smith2010}.
The same effect was also taken to show that, in contrast to the assumptions of strongly nativist theories of language, subtle biases in the individual can give rise to strong universal patterns when the learning and production of linguistic systems is iterated~\citep{Kirby1999}.

This latter idea has undergone implicit generalisation to other biases not necessarily directly related to language \emph{structure}, at the latest with~\citet{Kirby2004} who reframed the acquisition by individual learners as a Bayesian inference process. In the Bayesian framework, the task of a learner is to infer which of the possible grammars~$h$ out of a given grammar hypothesis space underlie the linguistic data~$d$ that they observe in learning. To do so rationally, the learner computes the \emph{posterior probability} of all possible languages~(hypotheses) given the learning data,\index{Bayesian inference}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:bayes}
p(h|d) = \frac{p(d|h) \cdot p(h)}{p(d)}\;.
\end{equation}

%In the symbolic, cognitivist framework embodied by the Bayesian approach that dominates much work in cognitive science today, 
The Bayesian learning framework, which has come to dominate much thinking about symbolic cognitive science in the past few decades, offered a natural grounding for iterated learning. It suggested a direct correspondence between the aforementioned `biases', previously defined as ``everything that the learner brings to the task independent of the data''~\citep[p.590]{Kirby2004}, to the \emph{prior} probabilities~$p(h)$ of the competing hypotheses in Bayesian inference. In this sense, biases could be made explicit simply by skewing the prior probability distribution over all hypotheses away from a uniform distribution corresponding to no a priori preference for any particular language. (It should be noted that, just in terms of \emph{asymmetries} between competing languages, a bias towards specific hypotheses~$h$ can also be introduced by adjusting the different hypotheses' data production structures~$p(d|h)$.)

Combining several such Bayesian learners in an iterated learning \emph{chain} would mean providing the first learner with some input data~$d$ from which they first try to infer the underlying hypothesis by computing their posterior distribution~$p(h|d)$. The learner would then become a `teacher' by producing some of their own data~$d$, either based directly on their posterior, or from a specific hypothesis chosen based on the posterior, passing this data on to the next learner and so forth.

Based on interpreting such chains of Bayesian learners as a stochastic Markov model~(a modelling approach that will be discussed in-depth in Section~\ref{sec:markovmodel}), it is possible to analytically derive the expected probability of observing any of the different hypotheses at a given point in time.
\citet{Griffiths2007} provided a mathematical proof that a chain's probability of exhibiting a hypothesis in this Bayesian inference-based version of the Iterated Learning Model~(BILM) should be identical to the prior distribution~$p(h)$, a finding which seems to run counter the empirical evidence which showed an \emph{amplification} of prior biases. \citet{Kirby2007} reconciled the two results by showing that, when learners adopt more deterministic strategies of selecting a hypothesis from the posterior such as choosing the hypothesis with the highest posterior probability, this will lead prior biases to become exaggerated as learning is iterated, especially when there are only small amounts of learning data available. While the question of which hypothesis selection strategy should be used can in theory be derived from experimental results for specific learning tasks, there is still no conclusive evidence on the matter~\citep{Reali2009,Ferdinand2015}.

% If learners adopt a more deterministic strategy — moving towards simply selecting the hypothesis with highest posterior probability — then iterated learning converges to a distribution that exaggerates the prior: hypotheses with high prior probabilities appear even more often, while those with low prior probabilities become even less likely. The exact distribution depends on how much data is seen by each learner, with the prior having a stronger effect when only small amounts of data are available. This analysis thus helps to explain the circumstances under which cultural transmission can magnify learning biases (allowing weak biases to be a potential explanation for strong linguistic patterns)

The iterated learning paradigm offers an individual-level complement to the macro-level analyses based on cross-linguistic data discussed above, and suggests a way in which the two levels of individual biases and typological distributions can be linked directly~\citep{Kirby1999,Kirby2008}. However, especially due to their origin in studies of the emergence of linguistic systems from scratch, iterated learning models are based on small population sizes, typically pairs of individuals arranged in chains or dyads, who have to learn from very limited and highly variable data in which learning biases are thought to express themselves most strongly~\citep{Fedzechkina2014}. As such, there are still two missing intermediate links between the two levels, namely the synchronic diffusion of traits through larger populations that already possess an established communication system, as well as their consequent spread through diachrony~(ibid, p.26). While the role of individual biases on the latter has received support through studies such as~\citet{Wedel2013short}, what is known about the spread of new linguistic variants at the micro-level of the population appears to be at odds with the idea of a straightforward expression of individual biases across all levels, as I will argue below.

Before I turn to a critique of adaptationist accounts based on universal pressures, however, it is also necessary to acknowledge another branch of research situated within the LCAS paradigm dedicated to uncovering the effects of general but not quite universal pressures, and their impact on language and language change.

%the same interaction between ``a tendency towards efficiency and a competing tendency toward redundancy'' was already proposed by~\citet[p.155]{Greenberg1954}~(printed in~\citealt{Osgood1954}), in a period that saw frequent export of concepts from the new field of information theory to other, more traditional areas of research~\citep{Shannon1956}.

\subsubsection{Adaptation to non-linguistic pressures}

Due to its general nature, the LCAS moniker does not just cover the study of \emph{universal} pressures associated with the iterated learning model, but also the investigation of non-universal (yet still generalisable) pressures and how they affect otherwise unrelated languages and language families in similar ways.
With the advent of large-scale databases on languages such as the World Atlas of Language Structures~\citep[WALS][]{WALS2013}, statistical studies have identified correlational relationships between linguistic structures and non-universal external, non-linguistic factors -- whether biological, geographical or social~\citep{Ladd2015}.

The first thoroughly established result of this kind is \citeauthor{Dediu2007}'s finding that the distribution of tonal languages in the world shows an unexpectedly large degree of overlap with the geographical distribution of two genes related to brain size~\citeyear{Dediu2007}. The authors posit that there might be a causal link between the two, with the existence of a certain biological substrate biasing language acquisition or processing towards certain language structures, in this case ones incorporating tone, a bias that would become exacerbated through iterated cultural transmission.

Many other suggestive correlational patterns have since joined this result, with the purported causality going either from environmental and social factors triggering changes or adaptations in linguistic structures~\citep{Lupyan2010}, or conversely from linguistic features to other social behaviours~\citep{Chen2013}. While the lack of concrete evidence for such effects beyond the stating of statistical macro-level correlations has received much criticism, it has also been argued to be an opportunity for both deriving and testing concrete mechanisms by which social and other external factors influence linguistic structure~\citep{Roberts2012,Nettle2012,Roberts2013correlation}. Specific claims as to how social scale can affect structural complexity indirectly, for example by changing the degree of input variability that individual learners receive~\citep{Wray2007}, have only just begun to be tested experimentally, lending no consistent support to any of the hypotheses that have been proposed so far~\citep{Atkinson2016}.
% "Languages evolve, adapting to pressures arising from their learning and use. As these pressures may be different in different sociocultural environments, non-linguistic factors relating to the group structure of the people who speak a language may influence features of the language itself."

% space of all possible languages -> `pointless' changes?

%LCAS suggests complex grammar spaces beyond simple switching back and forth between two conventions such as word order patterns.
%While there is evidence of some circular changes in language, e.g.~in the process of grammaticalisation, in the absence of a dedicated theory of why a pressure fails to kick in to drive the circle forwards for a certain period of time

%by external actuation such as \citet{Ritt2004} TODO or Baumann paper??
%in a similar way to \citet{Yang2002} who explains the rise of periphrastic `do' in Early Modern English through the influence of non-native speaker productions on the learners' primary linguistic data.
%While such accounts offer particular explanations for particular historical changes, they don't speak towards whether a \emph{general} theory of language change is possible.

With this newest branch of research on factors that are believed to be driving language change we come to the end of one long, more or less continuous arc of approaches that seek the source of language change in general, mechanistic pressures that are thought to be acting on languages at all times. Winding back to the early days of language-internal accounts I will discuss a criticism that has long been hauled at general explanations of language change and that is equally applicable to their modern, adaptively-minded incarnations: the actuation problem.

\subsection{The actuation problem \& sporadic language change}\index{actuation!actuation problem|textbf}
\label{sec:actuationproblem}

Returning back to an earlier period of linguistic study, the advent of structuralism that is typically associated with the publication of Saussure's \emph{Cours de linguistique générale}~\citeyearpar{Saussure1916} reset the focus from establishing historical relationships to the description of individual languages for their own sake. %This in turn raised puzzlement over why a working language should change.
Where in 19th century linguistics research diachronic concerns still played a central role, the systematic identification of the various functions served by \emph{synchronic} language structures under the new paradigm cast additional doubts on why language should change at all:

\begin{quote}
``the more linguists became impressed with the existence of structure of language, and the more they bolstered this observation with deductive arguments about the functional advantages of structure, the more mysterious became the transition of a language from state to state. After all, if a language has to be structured in order to function efficiently, how do people continue to talk while the language changes, that is, while it passes through periods of lessened systematicity?''~\citep[p.100]{Weinreich1968}
\end{quote}

The criticism embodied by the actuation problem is mainly directed at language-internal accounts, or any other account that attempts to explain changes through inherent asymmetries between competing variants.
While the move from the (over-)explanation of particular language changes to their framing in the light of \emph{universal} pressures that allow generalisation meant progress on the question of \emph{why} or \emph{in which direction} languages change, the approach was said to create ``the opposite problem -- of explaining why language fails to change.''~\citep[p.112]{Weinreich1968}:

\begin{quote}
``Why do changes in a structural feature take place in a particular language at a given time, but not in other languages with the same feature, or in the same language at other times? This \emph{actuation problem} can be regarded as the very heart of the matter.''~(p.102)
\end{quote}

Although there is no precise definition of `actuation' in \citeauthor{Weinreich1968}'s seminal paper and no consistent usage of the term in the literature has emerged since, it is generally understood to mark \emph{the point in time} when an incoming linguistic variant starts to see a consistent increase in its usage at the expense of established competitor variants, i.e.~the detectable \emph{onset} of the diffusion of a change\footnote{The term `actualization' \citep[with a specific meaning in grammaticalisation theory, see][p.24]{Traugott2011} is sometimes used interchangably~\citep{Andersen2008,Kiparsky2014}.}.

%but it may also refer to the \emph{mechanism or process} behind this increase.
% TODO rephrase What is at that point still only a change-in-the-making can in theory still be \emph{interrupted} by seeing its spread curtailed and reversed back to nonexistence, but one typically speaks of a change as \emph{actuating} when it starts to exhibit increase in usage that is consistently spread across speakers or speaker groups.

While language-internal accounts went a long way in terms of identifying general, inherent instabilities in or asymmetries between two language states, they typically fail to explain the inactivity of a pressure until its point of actuation, i.e.~why a change occurs \emph{exactly when it does}. %means it's again hardly falsifiable on an \emph{individual} basis.
This concern is aggravated by the fact that the myriad pressures that have been proposed to act on language provide a large amount of explanatory freedom by allowing researchers to choose from a whole pool of `explanations' more or less at will.

Formulated almost 50~years ago, the fact that the actuation problem is still frequently referred to even in contemporary literature on language change indicates that it has never been resolved completely. Importantly, the argument applies equally to accounts referring to domain-general or even external adaptive pressures that are the interest of LCAS approaches, which were also shown to be geared towards very general explanations of change. Particularly in iterated learning models we see a strong focus on universal pressures giving rise to \emph{universal features} such as compositionality, recursion, expressivity etc.~\citep{Brighton2002,Kirby2002,Cornish2009,Smith2013}. %That the criticism of the actuation problem applies equally to LCAS accounts which, as I argued above, are typically invoked to explain the \emph{universal}, but not the particular. Given the wide range of pressures invoked by LCAS approaches I want to cover a distinction between two types of language changes based on the source of asymmetry between them, a distinction that is not typically made since it cuts across the usual categorisation of changes depending on their domain of linguistic description, i.e.~sound, lexical, semantic and morphosyntactic changes.
%There are changes which do not change the nature of contrasts, therefore maintaining the system's expressivity. In the former case, the linguistic systems after the change are just as expressive or rich in contrasts as before, whereas in the latter case an argument can be made that the language has seen some overall improvement beyond the function of the particular convention that underwent change.
%This distinction between simple convention changes and system changes is important since they are typically argued to be explained by different biases. On the level of description that simply identifies differences between competing variants or systems, however, both types of changes are simply due to an inherent asymmetry between them, and the problem or criticism of actuation applies equally to both.
% But which will be relevant to counter different claims about the source of asymmetry in LCAS.
When there is room for variable expression of biases, the evolution towards any particular solution is triggered from the outside by experimental manipulation~\citep{Winters2015}, offering no internal account of why any particular bias might suddenly come to outweigh another one, thus triggering a change in an established, working language.
% Externally-triggered social effects are just as puzzling, since they only explain general tendencies but with many counterexamples

While some researchers allude to the `solving' of the actuation problem for particular changes they investigate\citep[e.g.][]{Baker2011,Stevens2013}, especially work dedicated to the study of the general principles of linguistic change acknowledge the issue of actuation much less. This might not be surprising, given that the full, general thrust of the argument often seems to speak against the possibility of any explanation of language change that goes beyond the account of one individual change and its particular circumstances of actuation.
The macro- vs. micro-level approaches to accounting for language change have led to a separation of concerns, where researchers are either dedicated to explaining \emph{which} changes actuate, generally, or otherwise to the question of when \emph{specific} changes actuate in particular. While I will propose a solution to address both those concerns at the same time in Section~\ref{sec:adaptationism}, we first need to discuss another strand of explanations of language change that arose from fieldwork on the dynamics of the spread and diffusion of linguistic changes through speech communities.

\subsection{Social accounts}\index{social accounts}
\label{sec:socialaccounts}

In the same period of the second half of the 20th century in which typological and generative work on morphosyntactic change indicated universal trends and directions of changes, sociolinguistic research %in the empiricist tradition
painted a wholly different picture of the spread of linguistic changes in parallel~(or rather orthogonal) to language-internal accounts.
Studies in what is sometimes also referred to as the \emph{variationist} tradition~\citep{Tagliamonte2015} have shown that there is a vast amount of variation in language use not just between but even \emph{within} individuals of one and the same speech community.
What these investigations across different languages and cultures have confirmed is that linguistic variation is not distributed randomly but in what \citet{Weinreich1968} call \emph{structured heterogeneity}, often reflecting the underlying social or political structure of the community with the usage of specific linguistic variants stratified according to social characteristics of the speakers such as their age, ethnicity, or socio-economic status~\citep{Foulkes2006,Tagliamonte2012}.
The importance of linguistic variation for the study of language change is again based on extrapolating the observed synchronic variation into time, by recognising that linguistic innovations do not spread evenly across geographical space, or even within speaker groups.

As was the case with language-internal accounts, it is difficult to find or give a precise definition of what exactly makes a `social account'. In contrast to language-internal accounts, social accounts are characterised by seeking the `reason' for the adoption or diffusion of a novel linguistic variant not in (features~of) the variant itself but in some external, social factors.
While social accounts of language change are primarily informed by empirical research of the \emph{micro-level} of linguistic variation and individual changes, sociolinguistic thinking goes beyond individual case studies.
Similar to the historical development of language-internal accounts, sociolinguistic research %over the past 60~years or so
has moved from the documentation and ad-hoc explanation of the social stratification of particular changes to the postulation of generalisable pressures that are presumed to hold across languages and cultures.

%Beyond intra-linguistic or functional effects, research have been looking for the effects that \emph{social} influences have on language change.
For the present purpose I will characterise and discuss two types of accounts that encompass most of the thinking on social influences on language change, the first one referring to \emph{mechanics} of social interactions, the other on the more fuzzy topic of the social \emph{meaning} of linguistic variation, and how it affects the spread of language change.

\subsubsection{Social network accounts}\index{interactor selection}
\label{sec:interactorselection}

While it is again hard to find explicit definitions for different types of social accounts, there exists a relatively clear subcategory of social explanations that stresses the important effects of social interactions. 
Inspired by the quantitative study of social networks and work such as the idea of ``weak ties''~\citep{Granovetter1973}, researchers have attempted to reduce the diffusion of language changes to the underlying distribution of social interactions in a speech, community, an idea clearly formulated very early on by~\citet[p.476]{Bloomfield1933}:

\begin{quote}
``The inhabitants of a settlement [\ldots] talk much more to each other than to persons who live elsewhere. When any innovation in the way of speaking spreads over a district, the limit of this spread is sure to be along some lines of weakness in the network of oral communication.''
\end{quote}

The quantitative, rule-like accountability of this ``principle of density'' of communication can again be seen to hark back to the ideal of mechanistic causal explanation, this time due to external, interactional factors~\citep[p.19]{Labov2001}. While the idea of reducing linguistic diversification to discontinuities in the social structures of speech communities has inspired both empirical~\citep{Milroy1985,Herold1997,Trudgill2008} as well as theoretical and modelling work~\citep{Nettle1999,Silva2008,Gong2012,Pierrehumbert2014}, many studies indicate that the relevance of this mechanism is limited.
%derived interaction frequencies between individuals~(such as due to social network structures)
\citet[ch.6-10]{Labov2010} in particular presents overwhelming evidence from work on the Atlas of North American English as well as the so-called Northern Cities vowel shift in particular, showing how the linguistic systems of neighbouring communities with plentiful cultural and economic contact between them are in fact often diverging in opposite directions rather than converging. Rather than reducing changes to a simple mechanism of interaction, these results are seen to indicate that the adoption of competing linguistic variants is not just a matter of automatic mutual accommodation, but that each individual's choice of change is a question of the variants' social meaning in use or, more simply, a question of \emph{prestige}.

\subsubsection{Prestige accounts}\index{prestige}
\label{sec:prestige}

Once again, terminological caution is advised, this time in relation to the many possible pressures referred to by \emph{prestige}. While prestige is intuitively understood to stand for a social bias \emph{towards} something, the word leaves open whether this bias is towards the speech of a high-status \emph{individual}, however they may be speaking at the time, or instead towards specific linguistic \emph{variants}. While early uses of the word are more typically referring to the (linguistic) status of individuals~\citep{Tarde1903,Fries1949}, today the term is almost exclusively used to refer to \emph{variant prestige}, a development that can be traced back to the influence of the idea of the `linguistic marketplace'~\citep{Bourdieu1977} that has taken a strong hold in sociolinguistic thinking~\citep{Cedergren1987,Chambers2008,Tagliamonte2015}.

Unlike the intuitive reading of `prestige', in the sense of an explicitly positive social valuation of a linguistic variant, the term has gathered additional meanings, such as the that of `covert' prestige~\citep{Trudgill1972}, which has made it a bit of a catch-all term that lacks specificity.
While the gist of prestige is still that linguistic changes are adopted (and in this sense \emph{caused} or \emph{triggered}) based on underlying changes in the social structure of a speech community, \citet{Labov2001} acknowledges that

\begin{quote}
``the force of Tarde's explanation [of reducing linguistic changes to underlying social pressures] may be considerably weakened if the term "prestige" is allowed to apply to any property of a linguistic trait that would lead people to imitate it. Thus the fact that a linguistic form has prestige would be shown by the fact that it was adopted by others.''~(p.24)
\end{quote}

The exact explanatory role of \emph{prestige} in sociolinguistics today is hard to pin down, not just due to the many different strands of research approaches present in the field~\citep{Tagliamonte2015}. At least the mainstream approach laid out by~\citet{Labov2001}, however, is clearly dedicated to some sort of sociolinguistic \emph{reductionism} of linguistic choices to underlying structures. Labov explicitly embraces the standpoint of~\citet{Meillet1926}:
%to ``follow Meillet's position that the sporadic character of language change can only be explained by correlations with the social structure of the speech community in which it takes place (1926:17)''~\citep[p.xv]{Labov2001}


\begin{quote}
``From the fact that language is a social institution, it follows that linguistics is a social science, and the only variable element that we can resort to in accounting for linguistic change is social change, of which linguistic variations are only consequences, sometimes immediate and direct, more often mediated and indirect. \ldots We must determine which social structure corresponds to a given linguistic structure, and how in general changes in social structure are translated into changes in linguistic structure.''~(translation from \citealt[p.22-23]{Labov2001})
\end{quote}

That this position is not taken by all sociolinguists is evidence by debates regarding whether social valuation exists prior to language use at all, as reflected in work on language and identity from which the sociolinguistic account of language change draws: \citeauthor{Bucholtz2004} note that ``much work within variationist sociolinguistics assumes not only that language use is distinctive at some level but that such practices are reflective, not constitutive, of social identities'', whereas in much of the linguistic anthropology work ``identity is better understood as an outcome of language use rather than as an analytic prime''~\citep[p.376]{Bucholtz2004}.

While sociolinguistic research has equally contributed to the identification of general, universal pressures that seem to be guiding language changes~\citep[see][for an extensive summary in relation to sound changes in particular]{Labov1994}, most contemporary population-level fieldwork on language variation and change is trying to come to terms with the idiosyncracy of individual changes. The fact that changes sometimes spread from `above' and sometimes from `below' the level of conscious awareness~(ibid.), from females to males or the other way around~\citep{Milroy1985,Eckert1989,Labov2001} challenges the idea that a purely mechanistic theory of language change is possible.
But no matter along which social dimension innovations spread first, a change is only a change if it is increasingly adopted by a speech community across the board. While research has shown that %, in contrast to the assumption of a critical period after which language acquisition is in a sense `complete' and language
language change~(or at least the adjustment of variable usage rates) within an individual's life span is indeed possible~\citep{Sankoff2007,Buchstaller2015}, the canonical case of change is still regarded to be the \emph{incrementation} of changes by younger speakers relative to their parental generation~\citep{Labov2001,Tagliamonte2009}. The fact that this incrementation occurs along the same social lines means from generation to generation has raised a particular interest in how the \emph{structured heterogeneity} of sociolinguistic variation is acquired by children and adolescents.

\section{Language change and language adaptation}\label{sec:adaptationism}\index{adaptation}

%Having covered most if not all of the relevant theories and thinking about the \emph{how} and \emph{why} of language change, 
Only few quantitative linguists today would deny that language \emph{evolves}, i.e.~that it that it undergoes \emph{change by replication}. The question of whether language change is \emph{adaptive} on the other hand is far from settled, or rather it is assumed to be settled in different ways within different subfields studying language change. Interestingly, the fault line does not coincide with the traditional boundaries of linguistic disciplines, such as phonetics, phonology, syntax, etc. Rather, as I have argued, it is largely a question of research methodology as well as the \emph{scope} of generalisation aimed for by different language change researchers.

The opinions held by the two camps -- those who hope to gain insight from framing language change as \emph{optimisation} of some sort vs. those sceptical of or categorically opposed to such a viewpoint -- go back far.
In light of the necessity to argue for some kind of \emph{asymmetry} to explain the shift from one linguistic variant to another, it is comparatively easier to find explicit arguments for change as improvement or adaptation of the lingustic system, such as \citet{Zipf1949}'s \emph{principle of least effort} discussed above.
The orthogonal view that change really is \emph{just change}, with no particular goal or direction, was in a sense the default view not just of laypersons who are generally not found to be fond of linguistic innovations~\citep{Labov2001}. The same view was adopted by many early Indo-Europeanists who, if anything, saw the beauty and perfection of ancient languages tainted and eroded by unsystematic, haphazard changes. As such, anti- (or at least non-)adaptationist arguments per se are found most explicitly as direct contradictions of adaptationist claims:

\begin{quote}
``Taking linguistic change as a whole, there seems to be no discernible movement towards greater efficiency such as might be expected if in fact there were a continuous struggle in which superior linguistic innovations won out as a general rule.''~\citep[p.69]{Greenberg1959}
\end{quote}

This point of view was taken even more strongly by researchers not working on cross-linguistic typology, such as in \citeauthor{Postal1968}'s well-known, somewhat more colloquial statement on syntactic change:

\begin{quote}
``There is no more reason for languages to change than there is for automobiles to add fins one year and remove them the next, for jackets to have three buttons one year and two the next, etc.''~\citep[p.283]{Postal1968}
\end{quote}

Despite very different methodological approaches and research agendas at the time, similar thinking prevailed at the other end of linguistic inquiry into phonetics:

\begin{quote}
``I do not think sound change creates any significant improvement or defect in language. There is sufficient redundancy in language that the message which speech encodes gets through as well (or no worse) before and after sound change. \ldots All human languages manifest asymmetry or disequilibrium in some part of their phonology but seem, nevertheless, to function adequately for communication. \ldots There is no need to appeal to ill-defined notions such as "system pressure", "pattern symmetry", "equilibrium", and the like, nor to maintain that the language is any better or any more "fit" as a result of these sounds changes. \ldots It seems languages are never satisfied! More to the point, it seems that languages are not seeking the satisfaction of some "ideal" configuration.''~\citep[p.191-192]{Ohala1989}
\end{quote}

Particularly within the study of sound change, this point of view is now widely accepted and essentially become textbook knowledge. For example, the entire introductory chapter of \citet{Labov2001} is dedicated to what he calls the \emph{Darwinian paradox}: \index{Darwinian paradox}

\begin{quote}
``There is general agreement among 20th-century linguists that language does not show an evolutionary pattern in the sense of progressive adaptation to communicative needs. \ldots The almost universal view of linguists is the reverse: that the major agent of linguistic change -- sound change -- is actually maladaptive, in that it leads to the loss of the information that the original forms were designed to carry.''~(p.10)
\end{quote}

%\citet[p.39]{Croft2000}
%``the empirical evidence indicates that linguistic selection is governed largely if not exclusively by social forces that have little or nothing to do with functional adaptiveness for communication.''

The same view is also adopted by \citet{Croft2006}, who concludes that ``all of the empirical evidence in language change indicates that social factors, not functional ones, are the causal mechanisms for the propagation of a change''~(p.116).

The list of supporters of the viewpoint that language change is at least to some extent adaptive is just as long and illustrious, with dedicated arguments for the cause by \citet{Jespersen1949}, \citet{Vennemann1993} and~\citet{Haspelmath1999,Haspelmath2008}.
Especially within typology the discussion seems to have reached a conclusion in the opposite direction, for example when~\citet{Wichmann2015} finds that ``Presumably language change is only to some extent random, and to a larger extent is adaptive''~(p.221).

%The general pattern seems to be that researchers diverge in their conclusion depending on whether they focus on the macro-level of language change -- \emph{which changes tend to occur} -- versus the micro-level of individual changes -- \emph{how do individual historical changes unfold}. This apparent schism in research questions and conclusions will reappear throughout this thesis, which itself will be concerned with the micro-level dynamics of individual language changes.

%Perhaps a more extensive argument for why actuation problem also undermines the explanatory power of universal pressures is necessary. This can also be made in a conceptual, visual manner. imagine space of all possible languages~(as is often done by functionalists, e.g. Jaeger2010).

%Most changes happen in the middle region and are kind of pointless. The universal pressures are satisfied in this space, so we shouldn't expect there to be strong intra-linguistic pressures driving the selection of particular variants.

%Wedel's functional load result is a case in point: let's assume (I think this would be in the spirit of Wedel) that there is a general laziness/economy/blending bias that would lead all phonemes of a language to merge. Since the 26 minimal pair threshold is a probabilistic rather than a deterministic predictor, we should probably think of the influence of each individual minimal pair as contributing towards an overall functional selection bias against merging the phonemes, a 'distinction-maintaining' bias that is in direct competition with the blending one. Now between those two pressures there is a sweet spot somewhere around 26 minimal pairs where the two biases balance each other out, so that at this point the decision of whether to merge or not to merge could go either way. On the 'macro' level, where we just ask the binary yes/no question of whether the population adopts a merger or not, this might be a satisfying result, but in our opinion it fails to speak to the 'micro' level of individual behaviour: what happens at or around this critical point, is there some non-linear response across individuals where half of them exhibit a tendency to merge the phonemes and half don't? Or, assuming a more gradual effect of the bias, wouldn't we enter the regime of neutral evolution of variants within every individual where the entire population should (in a synchronised fashion) drift around between sometimes merging the phonemes, and sometimes not?

%This question of the 'sweet spot' at which universal functional pressures that have presumably always been there on the individual level without affecting the community language suddenly kick in and start an ordered directed change is what the 'actuation problem' is all about. It should be noted that the quasi-deterministic requirement for a model of language change as quoted by the reviewer that "would predict, from a description of a language state at some moment in time, the course of development which that language would undergo within a specified interval" is not what Weinreich et al. had in mind either, in the immediately following paragraph they reveal this bold goal to be nothing but a straw man, stating that "Our own view is that neither the strong nor the modest version of such theories of language change, as they proceed from current generative grammar, will have much relevance to the study of language history".

%However, in our view a full account of the pressures that drive language change *has* to make specific predictions at the level of individual behaviour, since this is what gives rise to the population-level behaviour and not the other way around. In other words, accounting for a macro-level pattern while completely underspecifying how exactly the probabilistic pressures (as observed from cross-linguistic samples like Wedel's) actually get expressed on an individual level during one particular change won't do. While macro-level accounts (like the results regarding functional load) are of course worthwhile and interesting it can be dangerous to equate them with explanations for individual events. What we are asking for here is not a deterministic account of whether a change occurs or not, we are still dealing with probabilistic models here, but models of individual behaviour that, when put into interaction with other individuals, yield predictions about population-level shifts alongside equally specific predictions about the underlying individual behaviours that give rise to the different population-level scenarios.

A striking difference of focus in these last two quotes can be found in the `causal mechanism' for the propagation of particular changes, which is evidenced at the micro-level of the diffusion of changes, versus the `adaptive' nature of language changes that is observed as a synchronic fact.
What becomes evident here is that the idea of an `explanation' of a change depends on the level at which it is investigated:

\begin{quote}
``There is general agreement that the heart of the study of language change is the search for causes. It is what we generally mean by the explanation of change. While we would like to apply to this search the universal principles that govern grammar as a whole, it is also understood, following Meillet~(1921), that no universal principles can account for the sporadic course of change, in which particular changes begin and end at a given time in history. The actuation problem demands that we search for universals in particulars.''~\citep[p.90]{Labov2010}
\end{quote}

This quote succinctly summarises two different approaches to the question of causation, or `why' languages change. Firstly, Labov acknowledges that there are in fact two senses of `why', implying separate research interests with diverging priorities regarding the locus of `explanation'. On one hand, for researchers seeking to generalise over language changes, the `why' question is not actually asked of individual changes in particular, but is first posed as a general cross-linguistic `what' or `which', in order to identify universal guiding principles of change, such as the unidirectional patterns that have been shown to hold across languages. The simple `why' then becomes a `why \emph{that}, over and over again?' which, once a universal pressure has been identified, offers an explanation that is taken to generalise to individual instances of the change, without the need to refer to particular features of those instances. The second sense of `why' is the one most pressing for the researcher looking at particular changes, and is best rephrased as `why there and then'? This question has to take the actuation problem straight on, and can only be answered with particular reference to the specific conditions for the change, so as to explain why it actuated exactly when it did.

While diverging in their focus of explanation~(to the degree of incompatibility), the two approaches share a common scientific standard: both seek to explain changes in a deterministic fashion, in the sense of reducing changes to accountable, rule-like development, merely diverging on whether the underlying mechanism of change is based on micro- or macro-level descriptions of the change. What I want to propose here is that the two approaches can in fact be unified, but only by abandoning that very standard of explanation.
Counter to~\citet[ch.5]{Labov2010}, who argues for the existence of language-internal `triggering events' that can account for the actuation of particular changes, I want to suggest that one has to acknowledge the fact that individual changes occur at points in time that are, at least to the level of description available to the linguist, arbitrary and thus unpredictable.

Although this point of view would presumably resonate with many a researcher who is content with revealing generalisable patterns of linguistic changes, my goal is not to discard or even play down the actuation problem. 
What I suggest is to shift the focus away from the negative, seemingly irrefutable criticism of universal pressures to fail to account for the idiosyncratic nature of particular changes and their seemingly arbitrary onset. Instead, the criticism can be transformed into a challenge of constructively explaining the very feature of language change that is the underlying source of the actuation problem, namely its sporadic nature.
A complete theory of language change should not just offer an explanation of the macro-level dynamics and general direction of language change, but also provide a concise account of exactly \emph{why} the actuation of particular changes is unpredictable. %Rather than being oblivious to the question of actuation, a complete theory should not just predict the predictable general direction of change on the macro-level, but also provide an account that explains why the onset of particular changes at the micro-level is so sporadic.

As I showed above, much headway has been made on the question of how and in what way languages change in general, generalisations which are based on universal pressures and asymmetries. If one accepts those pressures which account for the strict uni-directionality of many changes and that seem to dictate the prevalence of linguistic traits across the globe, how can there still be room for systematic uncertainty and indeterminacy in language change?

At this point it is worthwhile to re-iterate a basic insight from evolutionary biology regarding the relationship between synchronic distributions and their supposed underlying diachronic processes: ``the prevalence of a particular species in a habitat does not necessarily imply that it is any better adapted to that habitat than its competitors''~\citep[p.2]{Blythe2012copying}.
Even though adaptive accounts of language change today are well-motivated and grounded not just in typological observations but also in theories of individual processing~\citep{Kirby1999,Jaeger2010}, neither of these two levels are sufficient to conclude that specific changes spread \emph{because} they are adaptive. So when \citet{Wichmann2015} writes that language change is to a large extent adaptive, this statement can be re-read somewhat less untuitively as `most changes that occur happen to be adaptive (but that is not the causal reason why they \emph{do} in fact occur)'.

The crucial point is that the mere fact of adaptation, or even evidence for the preferred spread of adaptive traits, should not be equated with evidence for \emph{selection based on the adaptiveness} of that trait or structure. % A case for replicator-neutral theories of language change.
The intention here is of course not to discard functional and adaptive pressures completely, but to raise the question of whether they should be construed as the pressures which drive the selection of linguistic variants on an individual basis.

 how functional factors play an important role within social accounts.


I will argue that by taking an evolutionary approach, the two viewpoints can in fact be unified.
But first I will elaborate on the quantitative and evolutionary approach to language change that is taken by this thesis, which are relatively well understood thanks to centuries of quantitative research on historically attested changes.

\section{Language change: a quantitative framework}

Qualitative descriptions

Attempts to characterise different types of changes (lexical, morphosyntactic, phonological, phonetic, pragmatic) in one framework.

Variationist studies introduced the concept of the \emph{sociolinguistic variable}.

\subsection{The sociolinguistic variable}\index{sociolinguistic variable}
\label{sec:sociolinguisticvariable}



``A linguistic variable in its most basic definition is two or more ways of saying the same thing''~\citep[p.4]{Tagliamonte2012}.
In more formal terms, different \emph{variants} of one of the same \emph{variable} have the property that they are ``identical in truth value, but opposed in their social and/or stylistic significance''~\citep[p.271]{Labov1972}. % in Nardy2012, p.256


Although language change can be studied on levels other than that of the sociolinguistic variable~\citep[see in particular][p.98]{Croft2006}, it is chiefly changes in the usage of sociolinguistic variables that will be covered in this thesis.

\subsection{Language change as language evolution}\label{sec:evolutionaryapproaches}

~(\citealt{Weinreich1968} would even attribute similar thinking to \citealt{Paul1920}).

\citet{Croft2000}'s evolutionary account of language change, based on \citeauthor{Hull1988}'s \emph{General Analysis of Selection}~\citeyearpar{Hull1988}, in which passive \emph{linguemes} are replicated by human \emph{interactors} engaging in communicative behaviour.\index{interactor}
%This has parallels in \citet{Boyd1985}'s models of cultural evolution.

One subtle different in the rhetoric of a strict evolutionary account is in how language change is framed. In particular, I will avoid adopting any metaphorical framing of linguistic change that somehow frames language as an active entity when, as a group of imitated human actions, they are really linguistic behaviours that are replicated passively.
Takes that even implicitly place the drive of languages to change as a feature of the language obscures the need to be explicit about the fact that we are looking for are mechanisms of the individual that leads them to alter the set of linguistic behaviours they engage in in some way.

What is interesting under such an approach is that, quantitatively, many different kinds of pressures and accounts presented above fall together. Both functional and social \emph{prestige} pressures, for example, are biases towards specific linguistic variants, which means they are both \emph{content biases} under \citeauthor{Boyd1985}'s terminology. So the only way that they could be distinguished in practice is by testing quantitative predictions regarding the underlying origin or source of this bias.


\subsubsection{Random drift}\index{neutral evolution}
% more metaphorical: Sapir
% more mechanical: Bauer etc.



Previously not considered, now on the table as very mechanistical accounts. Importantly, this (originally biological) notion of drift is not to be confused with \citet{Sapir1921}'s more figurative idea of linguistic \emph{drift}, which I will return to in the final chapter.

\subsubsection{Beyond biological metaphors: regulatory pressures}

Virtually all approaches to explaining linguistic changes discussed so far struggle with one and the same aspect of its dynamics, namely the sudden incrementation or transmission of change to a part of its grammar following long periods of stagnation or stability. The inability to account for this \emph{sporadic} nature of language change is not always acknowledged, and in fact often outsourced to triggers that fall outside the scope of the specific account of change itself, whether implicitly in the case of language-internal~(as criticised by the \emph{actuation problem}), or explicitly in the case of social accounts.
While the LCAS paradigm acknowledges the complexity of the many interacting pressures that are thought to underlie the spread of specific changes, the exact nature and dynamic of the transitions from stability to change are hardly ever accounted for or explained \emph{quantitatively}.

Beyond the attempts to explain language change in relatively simple mechanistic terms akin to the straightforward causal explanation of events that is perceived to prevail in some natural sciences, researchers have also acknowledged the inherent limitations of linear approaches in accounting for linguistic systems' behaviour that is in many respects irregular and spontaneous~\citep[see e.g.][]{Fortescue2006}.
In terms of external contributions to the study of language change, mathematicians and physicists in particular have brought the formal tools from their own domains to bear on questions of interest to linguists. Given the complexity of the methods involved, such contributions typically fail to have a lasting impact on thinking in the field if they do not form part of a broader linguistically-motivated research programme which makes it accessible to linguists. Since one such research programme will be presented in-depth in Chapter~\ref{ch:modelling} which also discusses the role of modelling more generally, I will limit myself here to an overview of conceptually motivated proposals from within the field of language change~(as well as cultural change more generally).

Interestingly, while evolutionary approaches as described above as well as the general spirit of reusing concepts and methodologies originally devised to study biological evolution to thinking about language change have become widespread~\citep{Atkinson2005}, only few efforts have been made to move beyond the straightforward models incorporating simple mutation and selection which are typically known to laypersons outside the field of mathematical and evolutionary biology.
\citet{Dixon1997} represents an early attempt at explaining sporadic change by transferring the idea of \emph{punctuated equilibria} to language change, but in the absence of a concrete quantitative model applicable to linguists, the idea failed to grow beyond its metaphorical basis.

non-linear effects
%The need for agreement on arbitrary conventions can ``bring about a rigid conformity that cannot be broken by small shocks''~\citep{Bikhchandani1992} even more than in other domains of culture.

Evolutionary approaches and social learning

\citep{Altmann2013,Acerbi2014}

While the current work on the \emph{incrementation} of language changes by means of amplifying trend can be traced back to \citet[ch.14]{Labov2001}'s concept of \emph{age vectors}, the idea that the \emph{history} of linguistic systems beyond its current state can influence how individuals change the language can also be found in much earlier work, even if only very implicitly, or at second reading.

One concept that has stuck around despite confusion around its exact conceptualisation % meaning
is \citet{Sapir1921}'s notion of linguistic `drift'~(not go be confused with genetic drift, aka neutral evolution). \index{drift}

 languages do not just diverge when there is social pressure to discriminate, but also have an internal `drive' to change (in place) by themselves (p.160).

But Sapir also alluded to the fact that underlyingly related but in the meantime isolated languages tend to develop in the same way, or the same direction. 

The idea that temporal stratification of a language forms a fundamental fact of a grammar is not new, as for example stated by~\citet[p.42]{Fries1949}:
\begin{quote}
``It is impossible to give a purely synchronic description of a complex mixed system, at one point of time, which shows the pertinent facts of that system; direction of change is a pertinent characteristic of the system and must also be known if one wishes to have a complete description of the language as it is structurally constituted.''
\end{quote}

\citep{Bailey1970} on building `rates of change' into synchronic descriptions

Interestingly, it appears that the reductionist, synchronically-focussed stance promoted by generativist approaches to language largely eradicated such thinking.

In the evolutionary approach to language change inspired by work in population biology, one typically thinks about the diffusion of the incoming \emph{variant} which is, beyond its initially low frequency, not explicitly assumed to be in any way marked relative to the established majority one.
Particularly in the sociophonetic literature though, one finds evidence of the notion of the diffusion of a \emph{change}~(rather than a variant), possibly to be construed as an incoming variant that is defined \emph{relative to} an established one. This becomes particularly apparent in \citet{Labov2001}'s notion of \emph{age vectors} discussed in Section~\ref{sec:agevector}. \index{age vector}
That this notion survived or re-emerged in the study of sound change is maybe not surprising, since the continuous nature of phonetic changes lends itself to thinking about changes as incrementing relative to an average pronounciation. In this sense it is also possible for individual language users to produce even `more incoming' pronounciations by extending the age vector beyond its current level of advancement. This differs from the incrementation of categorical variants, where the only way for an individual to advance a change is by increasing the relative usage frequency of the incoming variant.

\section{Summary}

From the many different \emph{biases}, \emph{pressures} and \emph{explanations} for language change that have been put forward it becomes obvious that it is often unclear how exactly these \emph{pressures} are supposed to be understood quantitatively.

Ellucidating the respective roles of the different pressures is one of the goals of this thesis. The next chapter is dedicated to the role that computational modelling can play to ellucidate this, and we will return to this point in Chapter~\ref{ch:bigpicture}.
%The next two chapters are dedicated to the computational and empirical investigation of a relatively understudied regulatory pressure, namely the detection \emph{trends} in the usage rates of linguistic traits, and their amplification by individuals.
